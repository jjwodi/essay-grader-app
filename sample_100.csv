AAAVUP14319000150379,"Scientists believe Venus is dangers and some think Venus is the ""most earth-like planet in our solar system. Some dangers is "" not a single spaceship has touched down on venus in more than three decades."" The author makes it clear that there is both good and bad about Venus. Some of the things that readers can notice is that there's a lot of intresting facts about Venus and how little scientist actually know about Venus. Venus is the second planet from the sun and occasionally orbit the sun a different speeds. If Venus is the most earth-like planet then why do scientist find it so hard to find out more about venus. A reason is ""800 degrees fanrecheit atmosphere preseure is 90 times greater."" Venus is the nearest option for a planetary visit. If "" hostile conditions on surface of venus would allow scientist to float above the fray."" Many researches are working on innovations that would allow machines to last long enough to contribute knowledge of venus. It would be so cool if scientist and researches could one day come up with an innovation to be able to find more about venus. If venus is actually a second earth-like there can probally be another earth. So yes, venus is worth studying despite the dangers it represents. ",2
AAAVUP14319000146836,"in the ""challenge of exploring venus"" the author says that venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. He supports all his claims further in to the article. he says that it is one of the hottest planets even though its not directly next to the sun the pressure holds the heat in, its hot enough to melt certain metals but he says that scientists ar taking the risk because its so far the only planet that could have been just like earth in the past. he brings up some of the characteristics that venus has that earth has too and he also brings up some of the physical features that makes them think there was living life on it at some point and time in the past. Our sister planet could have been covered in many oceans and held many kinds of life. just those little two facts bring the scientists in and make them wanna learn more about it. venus has rocky sediment, mountains and craters which earth all has. in order to explore venus they would have to be very careful because how deadly and dangerous it could be they bring up a spacecraft very relative to a blimp that they would be able to use and study and explore venus from a very safe area without causing any harm to the scientists on board they would be about 30 or so miles above the surface area it would still be very hot around 170 degrees farenheight but do able because the blimps outer layer would keep the scientists from burning up or getting too hot . they are coming up with other ideas other than the blimp like spacecraft they havee also come up with the idea to send a roverthat is made out of silicon carbide that has lasted 3 weeks in venus like conditions. the scientists only want to learn more about venus mostly for its path and what it could have looked like and to make a breakthrough with some big news that venus was almost identical to the place we live on called earth. as the author says in his last paragraph ""striving to explore venus has value not only because of the insight that will be gained but out of your normal human curiosity"" for the last point he says "" our travels on earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation."" which in total supports his whole statement of is venus a worthy pursuit despite the dangers.",3
AAAVUP14319000139239,"Venus is a planet from our solar system, it is said that venus is the hotest planet in our solar system. Earth, Venus, and Mars, our other planetary neighbor, orbit the sun at different speeds. Venus is sometimes right around the corner in space serms humans have sent numerous spacecraft to land on this cloud draped word.

Acoording to the article it is said that not a single spaceship has touched down on venus in more than three decadees. In venus it is said that the atmosphere is almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets. On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressuere is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. On Venus weathe present additional impediments like eruption volacnoes, powerfol earthquakes, and frequent lightnig strikes ot probbes seeking to land on its surface.

This prove that the author idea is well supports it and venus is worthy of studying despite the dangers.

Scientists even discussing further visits to its surface, because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. It has been said that, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth, Today, Venus still has come features that are analogous to those on Earth. Many researchers are working on innovations taht would all ow our machines to last long enought to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of venus.

Acooring to the author article idea and infornmation, all of this understandble. It show a lot of detai and evidence about Venus. For example: How hot it is "" A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus."" and "" At thirty plus miles bove the surface, temperatures would still be toasty a around 170 degrees Fashrenheit. There for the author idea are supports it well.                                            ",3
AAAVUP14319000121942,"How is it challanging of exploring Venus?? Venus is sometime call The ""Evening Star"". Venus is call that because Venus is the second planet from our sun.While Venuse is simple to see from the distant but safe vantage point of Earth, it has proved a very challenging place to examine more closely.Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too.

These differences in speed mean that sometimes we are closer to Mars and other times to Venus. Because Venus is sometimes right around the corner—in space terms—humans have sent numerous spacecraft to land on this cloud-draped world. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus’s atmosphere. On the planet’s surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth; such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals. Also notable, Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to our sun.

Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.That is why venus is call the twin to earth. comparison, systems that use mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces.

AAAVUP14319000086739,In this article they say the dangers of going on venus. they make it to where it is suitable for people to go on they make it to where theyre standing and floating 30 miles in the air . the pressure makes it harder for it to be liveable and the heat . They say its like taking an electronic on a machine chamber and letting it go and get heated and melt. venus has the hottest surface tempeture of any planet because its closer to the sun.they orbit the sun at different speeds which is why density is so high on venus. Humans have sent numerous spacecrafts to land on venus. it didnt seem to work out but they sent humans there and tried to make it live able for them . The humans studied the planet and tried to get it to where it is most comfortable for people to go. they cant send electro devices because it will only damage them. They put them 30 miles in the air so that they wont feel the heat and pressure against their bodies. this is the best suitable way for them to make it on the planet venus.,1
AAAVUP14319000082385,"In the article, ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" The author explains why it would be a good idea to explore our neighboring planet of Venus. Despite all of the possible problems that can easily arise, the author claims it is a worthy pursuit. From evaluating the article personally, I believe the author supported his argument very well with even being able to counterargue many counterclaims by stating different innovations and different ideas that can make travelling to the ""Evening Star"" a reality.

The author claims it is important to study Venus due to it's striking similarities to Earth. The author states in paragraph 4 that scientists believe that Venus was once the most similar planet to Earth, once believed to probably be covered in oceans and probably even supported life. Even today, it is speculated that Venus has many land masses like ours such as mountains, valleys, and craters. The author also states in paragraph 4 that Venus can easily be our nearest option for a planetary visit considering how close it is.

Although, the horrible conditions of the planet have not allowed any human made spacecrafts to land on Venus for more than a few hours before being either torn apart or simply returning. However, after this claim from paragraph 5, the author uses support from NASA to state how humans could still visit the planet, however, will have to only hover over it about 30 miles into the atmosphere to avoid getting into serious danger. The author claims that although these still are not perfect conditions, they will be suitable for humans to survive in. The author then goes on to compell the arguement that they would not be able to collect any samples or even photo or videograpghy due to it being dangerous or ineffective. He therefore states in paragraph 6 that if scientists are seeking to conduct a thorough mission, that they need to get up close and personal with the planet.

The author also states in paragraph 6 as well how many scientists take Venus as a challenge and are actually coming up with different innovations in order to tackle Venus' tough environment with a surface that can reach up to 800°F and the immense 90 times greater pressure than Earth. These technologies include mechanical parts like found in the first computer had in order to be more resistant to heat and pressure being made from silicon carbide, which when tested in a chamber that simulated Venus conditions, survived a staggering 3 weeks.

Later, in paragraph 8, the author states that being presented a challenge to get to Venus has value. ""Not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us to many equally intimidating endeavors,"" the author states in paragraph 8. The author claims that if we are able to tackle an astonashing feat such as Venus who is our neighboring planet, then we have unlocked the key to tackling many greater challenges.

In conclusion, I believe the author supports his claims very well due to him being able to understand the dangers of the challenge. However, the author then was able to find different supporting facts and innovations that can make a trip to Venus by man possible and seem more appealing nevertheless.      ",5
AAAVUP14319000075334,"The main argument for visiting Venus is a very simple one the author presents in paragraph 2: it is considered by many to be ""Earth's Twin"". Despite this however, the atmosphere in Venus is dangerously hot, over 800-900 degrees kind of hot. It would burn anything that entered its atmosphere within seconds. It would be incredibly difficult and expensive to visit Venus first out of all of the planets in out solar system.

For one the atmosphere is so hot to the point to where NASA would be spending millions of dollars into developing a ship that is built for that kind of heat and pressure. Even then we cannot be 100 percent sure that it wont just burn up upon contact due to all of the sulfuric acid in the atmosphere that would have to be taken into consideration. Mars would be much easier for us to get to first, it's bigger, nowhere even remotely close to how hot Venus is. Even having a sort of blimp like vehicle hover 30 miles above the atmosphere might not help. What if one of the so called volcanos on the planet erupted and hit it? That is millions of dollars out of the window right there alone. The planet is simply put too hostile for human interaction. Mars would be a much safer option for human beings.

In conclusion, the overall idea of us going up to Venus is one that is do-able, but that is far off in the future. We do not have the money or resources to even think about going up to that planet yet. Mars should be first and foremost up for discussion if we are going to investgate another planet. Venus is too dangerous right now, when technology improves for us we may be able to, but for now, we should stick to trying to land on other planets that are less hostile and unpredictable.",3
AAAVUP14319000069867,"In my opinion I'm kinda half and half on exploring Venus, the ""Evening Star."" I think it would be a great idea yet kinda bad. Why? Well let me tell you why I'm half and half. Think about all the lives we would lose. We could make prototypes of the shuttle and keep sending them until we get it right.

But what if they get perfect results from a protoype? And build the shuttle the same exact way. Then send it up with people in it. But something happens to the shuttle. Like catches on fire or blows up when it hits Venus's surface or atmosphere. Very risky. This is why I say it's a bad idea.

But wait! I think it's a good idea too. Let me tell you why. We've only been to the moon and I think it would be nice to explore a new planet. They just need to make a Special rover or robot that could with stand any climate. Like made out of tough materials.

They could make that blimp like vehicle said in paragraph 5. Drop the rover in a pod down to explore the tough climate of Venus. Once they do that they could explore with the rover and gather samples from the planet. Whe nthey study the samples, scientist will send people to explore.

So that is why i'm kind of half and half about exploring Venus.   ",2
AAAVUP14319000068442,"This article is called ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus."" The article is about the planet Venus. Venus is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky, which makes it simple to find even for an amateur to spot. Venus is the second plaent from the our sun. But there are challenges of exploring Venus like

how

venus is simple to see from the distant but safe vantage point of Earth, it has proved a very challenging place to examine more closely. ""Is worth studying Venus despite the dangers it presents?""

The author who wrote this article suggest that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the

dangers it presents. The reasons why the author thinks that is because astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may has

well once have been the most Earth- like planet in our solar system. Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. Venus has a rocky sediment surface, that includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters.

In the article the author says that the value of returning to Venus

seems indisputable, but what are the options for making a mission both safe and scientifically productive.

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration is taking the challenge of exploring Venus. They have one particularly compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus. Their solution is to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus. Which would allow scientists

to float above the fray. Peering at Venus from a ship orbiting safely far about the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions but researchers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance. Scientists are seeking to conduct a thorough mission to understand that Venus would need to get up close and personal despite the risks.Researchers are working on innovaations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus.

The main reason why the author thinks that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the

dangers it presents is because humans curriosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidation endeavors. In the article he says that, ""The travels beyond Earth should not be limited by dangers and doubts but they should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.""

""Do I think that Venus is worth studying despite the dangers it presents?"" I think that it is worth it but I also think that

it is not worth it. The reasons why I think it is not worth the dangers is because humans have sent numerous spacecraft to land on this cloud-draped world. But each misssion was unmanned because no spacecraft has survived a landing for more than a few hours. That is why not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades is because it is not safe for humans. Some

of the challenges that are dangers to humans is that, the atmosphere is almost 97 percent of carbon dioxide blankets. What is more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid Venus's aatmospherte. Venus planet's surface temperatures average overr 800 degrees Fahrenheit.The atmospheric pressure is 90 times

greater than what we experience on Earth.

There conditions are so extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth and that is why humans and the spaceship only last a few hours. The reasons why I agree that studying Venus is worth it is because NASA is working on other aprroaches to studying Venus instead of putting humans lifes in danger. One of the ways NASA is working on is some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide thas has been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's suface. It has lasted for three weeks in certain conditions. Another project they are working on is exposing

a cell phone or tablet to acid or heat capable of melting tin. By comparison, systmes that use mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat, and

other forces. But I do agree that traveling beyond Earth should

not be limited by dangers and

doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation. Unless it is somone you care that is about to risk their life for science. Then it is not worth loosing someone people's lifes.

In conclusion, ""Is it worth studying Venus despite the dangers it presents?""

It just depends on how you see it. The author thinks that it is worth it because of the

insight that can be gained on Venus itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors. What I think

is that it's

worth it but it is also not because there been missions to Venus and no spacecraft has survived the landing for more than a few hours. People on their spaceships has risked their lifes for science, so it is not worth the risk. Also it is worth studying Venus if there is a better away to study Venus because NASA

are finding other ways to study Venus. One of the main reasons why it is worth studying Venus despite the dangers is because of what the author said in the article. The author said, ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges

of imagination and innovation."" ",4
AAAVUP14319000068160,"From the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" it describes many reasons about how venus is not safe, but once along time ago could've looked like earth. Venus also know as Earth's ""twin"" is very close to earth. Venus has very many reasons about why humans havent been on it in three decades. ""no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours"" which tells me exactly how dangerous it actually is.

""on the planet's surface tempatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit"" which is extremely difficult to survive on. Imagine people from Earth going up to a place with 800 degrees Fahrenheit, no-one would make it out alive. Venus which ""97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere"" which to me as very deadly as well.

Having all this horrible enviroment, it ""would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals."" which in my opinion would kill anyone their. Despite how deadly Venus seems, scientist want to go visit it anyway because they believe humans and animals lived on it before. ""Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like earth""

Since astrounauts can't take samples of rocks, gas, or anything else, from a distance is nearly impossible because of its conditions. Hovering in a ship above Venus is limited to ground level because you cannot seethat far. Also sense light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere.

From all about what i've learned i can tell that Venus is extremely difficult for any living thing. Since astrounauts haven't landed on Venus in three decades proves that its way far from safe. Being able to not get samples such as gas, rocks, or anything they will never be able to tell if humans lived on it long ago making me believe that Venus is beyond dangerous and should be avoided.

AAAVUP14319000066301,"Scientists wants to keep on exploring venus even tho it is dangerous. One reason I think they should is because they should get information about things they brealy know about. My second reason is because they might find someuseful things if they keep on studing it. My last reason is because it might not be as dangerous as people make it out to be. These are some reason why scientist should keep studing venus.

In addition I do think that the scientist should keep studying venus for some of these reasons. Reason one is because of the information that they can find id they keep looking into it. My second reason is that they might find some useful information if they keep studing the plant. My last reason is because it might not turn out to be a dangerous place as people say it is.

In conclusion I do think its a good idea for people to keep studing venus. My first reason was because it could give the scientist more information on the plant. My second reason was they might find some useful information that coild help them. My last reason was venus might not be a dangerous place as people make it out to be. So i think this is why some scientist should study venus more.",1
AAAVUP14319000063348,"The story "" The Challenge Of Exploring Venus"" was all about venuse. The story explained that Venus is

dangerous, it's not safe for people to go up to Venus and they are thinking about sending technology to Venus.

Venus is very dangerous. In the story it say that ""venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system"". That is not good imagine a (NASA) researcher going to venus to get information they would not even make it back because of how hot it is. Venus is something were people should not go. Also in the text it says that ""Venus would not allow scientists to float above the fry"". That quot from the text is very important because it is clealy warrning you that it is dangerous.

Venus is not very safe for humans/researchers. In the story it says that "" beyond high pressure and heat, venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes and frequent lightning strikes to probes seekinhg to land on its surface"". Just reading that littke sentence you can tell Venus is no joke it is very dangerous. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration would not even send a human to study Venus.

In the story the author talked about sending mechanical computers to Venus to get the information they need. That would be very smart to send old technology

(Mechanical computers) insted of humans it would be way safer. In the story the author states that ""These divices were first envisioned in the 1800s and played an important role in the 1940s during World War II"".

So I belive that if these mechanical computers did the job back in 1940s then it can do the job now because we have better technology no then we did back then. Also it states in the story that ""modern computers are enormously powerful, flexible and quick but tend to be more delicaye when it comes to extrem phisical condidtions"". If they send these computers they can really get their information andit would save more human lives because then the humans would not have to go to Venus toget the information they need.

In conclusion Venus is dangerous, its not safe for humans to go up to venus and they are thinking about sending tecnology computers to get information.",3
AAAVUP14319000060616,"Why is Venus worth pursuing more reasearch. In the article paragraph 2 the author states Venus if often referred to as Earth's twin. Also it is the only other planet closes in terms of desity and size.

It is also said that there has be no spacecraft to survive the landing more than a few hours. It is said to be Venus's reputations has made it challenging to study.

Paragraph 4 says ""If our sister planet is so inhospitable, why are scientists even discussing further visits to its surface?"" After that the author sates that astronomers think that Venus once was like earth a long time ago. Venus has features that are alike on Earth.

Venus has a suface of rocky sediment that may be like valleys, mountains, and craters. The author says ""that Venus can sometimes be our nearet option for a planetary visit, a crucial cosideration given the long time frames of space travel.

So why is it worth studing Venus more despite the dangers.It is like a second Earth. In paragraph 7 it says ""NASA is working on other approaches to studing Venus. In example some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide

have been tested in a chamber acting as Venus surface and lasted for three weeks in the harsh conditoins. So there for it will be sfae to send more spacecrafts to Venus. Then after studing more and correcting the problems. You can send people to Venus to get a better veiw on it. In paragraph 6 the say it would be smart to hover over Venus from a safe distant. Althought the atmosphere dont let you see much. Making it hard to get photos or videography ineffective.Also they can't take any sampes of rocks to test and study them from a distance. So they seek to find the best solution to land on Venus.",3
AAAVUP14319000052069,"Visiting Venus might be challenging but it is fun to Study and talk about. According to the article, ""While Venus is simple to see from the distant but safe ventage point of Earth, it has proved a very challenging place to examine more closely"". In this statement, it shows that Venus is a close planet to earth but we can only see it from distance because people cannot go there.

Venus is a planet that is dangerous for people to go because of its climate weather. In paragrapg 2, ""Each previous mission was unmanned, and for good reason, since no spacecraft survived that landing for more than a few hours"". This article shows that because Venus is a dangerous place for visiting and everyone that went their cannot survive it for two hours. In paragraph 3, ""A thick atmsphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challanging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere"". This article proves that Venus climate is very bad because their temperature is over 800 degrees Fahrenheit.

According to NASA, a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way. This means if NASA wants to see how Venus looks like they need to send a jet or other flying machines

that would overcome every obsticles on its way. ""It also shows that flying thirty-plus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degress Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth. Solar power would be plentiful and radiation would not exceed Earth levels"". This statement clearly shows that in this climate weather, most humans would not be able to survive in 24 hours. It shows that with this weather people would be sick and people would not be able to breath because of the high temperate.

In paragraph 8, It shows that we should not give up on visiting Venus because of the climate change or because of the challenges that we have to face before we survive.""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.

In conclusion, Venus is the closest planet to earth and it is also the secound planet from the sun but it is a very challenging place to visit or see how doing are doing. Venus has the average temperature of 800 degrees Fahrenheit and it also have a very bad climate. According to NASA idea, Venus hostile condition would allow scientist to float above the fray, which means they can go to Venus but they would have to face some challenges like avoiding rocks and other hard materials coming their way in order to survive the journey.

AAAVUP14319000045877,"Our curosity leads us to many things despite the dangers, Every human on earth are curious, about something. Curosity can lead us to danger or it can lead us into something big.

The author claims well enough to make you think, if studing venus is worth doing. Despite the dangers isn't it better to try then not have tried at all, progress is still progress. Someone or some, but a lot are curious, it is what makes us human, thinking of doing or having the challenge in us. Wouldn't it be amazing to to discover what Venus has in store? Venus could have things that we never thought of could exist, this makes the progress worth knowing. This made me feel curious of knowing more about it, One day knowing what scientist have discovered in planet Venus could be something amazing.

The danger that comes along with worth studing venus seems better not to try to move on with our lifes and stop trying to explore venus. But has that stopped people doing amazing things despite the danger it comes along with it? People have climbled all the way to the top of

Mount Everest being the biggest mountain on earth, coming along with danger with involving death or getting your hand or leg getting cut off because of the low temperatures. People going through the heardest things in life but later on succeding even when getting discriminated or getting yourself killed. But then you are known to being the most inflentual person on earth.

These devices were first envisioned in the 1800's and played an important role in the 1940s during world war II . The thought of somputers existing in those days may sound shocking, but these devices make calculations by using gears annd levers and do not require electronics at all. Modern computers are enormosly powerful, flexible, and quick, but tend to be more delicate when it comes to extreme physical conditions. Just imagine exposing a cell phone or tablet to acid or heat capable of melting tin. By comparison, systems that use mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat and other forces."" So that's a step to trying to get to know more about it. Anything is possible if you put your mind to it.

Even though we been on earth for a thousands of years, But we are just getting to know or discover more things even out of our planet earth. Curosity is always on are minds for an example how many candies do you think are in that jar? or how did you make that object fit when it seems impossible to make it fit, and many more that makes us wanting to know more.

AAAVUP14319000043773,"Venus is the closest plane to Earth in terms of density and size, and ocasionally the closest is distance too. Venus is called the ""Evening Star"" because its one of the brightest points of light in the sky. Its atmosphere is very dangerous and its temperature is around 800 degrees Fahrenheit. If Venus is a very dangerous place to go study, why would we go? This is what we are going to see about here.

Venus has a lot of dangerous problems that it kinds of limit us from visiting it. One of the problem is that Venus has: ""a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide."" and this makes our visit extremely dangerous.

Also, Venus's atmosphere's clouds are made of highly corrosive sulfuric acid. The atmospheric pressure there is 900 times bigger than what we experience here in Earth.

Each previous misson to Venus was unmanned, and for good reason, since no spacecraft suvived the landing for more than a few hours. Maybe this explain why not a single spaceship has touched down on venus in more than three decades.

""venusian geology aand weather present additional impediments like erupting vulcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightining strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface."" This are huge problems in Venus that maybe can limitate the life in our ""twin"" planet. Even Venus showing a lot of dangers and even a lot of spaceships failing missions going to venus, why do researchers still

want to study Venus?

Venus is not only bad, Venus have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. As said in the text: ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" Venus has a surface of rocky sediments and includes valleys, mountains, and craters, looking similar to Earth's biomes.

Even with high temperatures of 170 degrees celsius in 30 plus miles above the surface, this planet still survivable for humans.

A problem that scientist face there is that: ""Most forms of light cannot pennetrate the dense atmosphere, rendering standard forms of photography and videography ineffective."" With this, researchers cannot take samples of rocks, gas, or anything else, from a distance.

Even facing some hard outcomes, NASA is working on other approachers to studying Venus, such as: ""For example, some simplified eletronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions.""

There's a big chance of going back to the use of old technologies, as

mechanical computers because the mechanical computers works using gears and levers and do not require electronis at all. ""Modern computers are enormously powerful, flexible and quick, but tend to be more delicate when it comes to extreme physical coditions.""

In my opnion, is it totally worth to study Venus because of its similarity to the Earth. As everyone knows, pollution is out of control in our planet and someday this can cause a huge problem and force us to go somewhere in the space. I do not think we will have to go to another planet due to the polllution. In my mind, all the pollution will be solve one day, or maybe everyone will die due to natural causes, as Tsunamis, hurricanes or another huge disasters or diseases. But, it is always important to prevent this and always have a second plan if something bad happens.

I also think that is totally worth to study Venus to know more of our galaxy and to know more about our galaxy planets to see similarities with Earth, maybe discovering some similar planets that are human can live there.

Earth and Venus are very similar country, having a potential of someday live there if life in Earth get no longer possible in the future.

In my opinion, it is important to research and study about Venus but is also important

to look for another similar planet to Earth with maybe even more survivable points for human than Venus.

Venus looks to be the Earth's ""twin"" and someday, researchers will find out a way to make it even more survivable to humans. Until they don't find out, let's keep taking care of Earth so we don't depend on other planets to be our future of living. ",3
AAAVUP14319000041571,"The author feels that further studys on Venus are dangerous but worth the time and effort. In this passage he discribes the conditions and states the challenges that come with the exploration of Venus

Venus, our lovely ""Evening Star"" or our ""Sister planet"", sounds beaustiful doesnt it. Don't be fooled by the nicknames of this planet, have you ever heard ""Looks can be deseaving? If so you shoud keep that in mind when you are thinking about Venus. Venus is the second planet from the sun but

has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in the entire solar system, even with Mercury being the closest to the sun. With an atmosphere of almost 97 perent carbon dioxide, and temperatures 170 degrees miles away, living there would be impossible. On the surface there are erupting valcanos, huge earthquakes, and probes that land on its surface have been reported to be shocked by lighning. Venus got the Sister planent name due to its similar dencity and size to planet earth, there also is a therey that Venus was one coveredwith oceans, rocky sediments similar to valleys and mountains and could have been obtaining

some type of life forms.

Humans are known for their curiosety, even when it could leave them dead. In order to do any further reacurch on Venus, technologys that can withstand insane amounts of heat would have to be created then tested. Scientists have yet to explore enough of Venus, it is difficult to collect rocks, dust, or gasses for any type of examination. I feel that in the future, a scientist will create a device that can help explore the surface of Venus safely amd effectively.

Reading this passage really made me interested in learning about venus, and i also feel that further exploration would be worth waiting for the correct technology. Further studies would be effective because we would know more about the mystories of space.    ",3
AAAVUP14319000019493,"The challenge of Exploring Venus is a pretty big challenge. Venus is often referred to Earth's twin. Venus is the closest pranet to earth in terms of density and size. Venus and the Earth orbit the sun at different speeds. Venus is sometimes right around the corner in space, humans have sent numerous spacecraft to land on this cloud-draped world. No spacecraft has survived the landing fo rmore than a few hours.

There are a lots of challeneges of landing on Venus. Like a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere. On other planets the temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit. This is 90 times greater than what we experience on the Earth. It's dangerous for people to land on venus because Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system, Even though Mercury is closer to our sun.

On Venus there are erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes. This is really dangerous for us to spend a lot of money on that then a lightning just hits us or something. Venus is a really dangerous planet if compared to the Earth. But scientist are still discussing further visits to its surface. It's because Venus may well once have been the most Earth-like Planet in our solar system. Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters.

NASA has one particularly compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus. NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. However, peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can only provide only limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense.

There are a lot of dangers of going to Venus. But I think if we can land there we can have a chance of making that the second earth. Venus has a lot of reasons why people can't live there but they called it as the most likely planet that is closer to earth.      ",3
AAATRP14318001013910,"The use of this technology to ready the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is not valuable. Why? to me this idea has some pros and cons. In the case of the Mona Lisa it seems a lot more reasonalbe to use this type of technology because in reality if we just look at the painting we dont know what her emotions are but since whis new Facial Action Coding System came out it'd be a lot more usefull on her than in students in a classroom.

Now these days students don't have a lot of excitment to come to school and are often distracted with the other things going on around them. If you have the Facial Action Coding System have them identify their emotions they will pay even less more attention in class. Wether or not a student isn't as excited to do math homework is the FACS gonna be able to change the students way of feeling towards the homework? Will the students way of feeling about homework change by a computer system? I honestly dont think it'd be a good idea to have that kind of system in a classroom.

In my opinion the idea of having it in a classroom is a bad idea. This system may work on other things but not in a classroom with students. This system can also fail. If a student is happy but just has a serious face the sysytem is going to go by what the student looks like not the way he/she actually feels inside.

Technology now a days is taking over everything, this FACS

will just make people much lazier because they know that instead of asking the way they feel they'll just want to use the system because its much faster and easier instead of going up to the person and actually asking how they feel. It'll create less comunication with one another.

The Facial Action Coding System doesn't seem to me a useful technology system for students in a classroom.",3
AAATRP14318000951793,"After a difficult test, have you ever wondered how your classmates felt? Did they think the test was as challenging as you perceived it? With the Facial Action Coding System, you would be able to tell your classmates' exact emotions. In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"", Nick D'Alto informs his readers of this new technology. The Facial Action Coding System, FACS, would be valuable to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom.

A computer software that can recognize emotions was invented by Prof. Thomas Huang, of the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science at the University of Illinois, and Prof. Nicu Sebe of the University of Amsterdam. Dr. Huang has worked with psychologists, like Dr. Paul Eckman who invented the FACS. D'Alto states, ""Eckman has classified six basic emotions-happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness-and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial features.""

The FACS would be effective in figuring out what students are interested in or not. This would help captivate, and maybe even excite, students into coming to school, for they would be doing assignments they genuinely enjoy. Using this advanced technology that detects emotions, teachers could modify their lessons to what made their students feel happy. ""'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confuse or bored,' Dr. Huang predicts,"" the text declares.

School counselors could utilize the FACS to help out students. If a student came to their counselor for help, the counsleor could figure out the exact emotions the student had using the FACS. This would help the counselor give appropiate advice to the student. This strategy would approve the attitude of students.

Bringing the FACS into schools would greatly improve the students' and the teahcers' school lives. This new technology can recognize six emotions and can even ""indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one."" The FACS would help teachers create lesson plans their students would have fun doing. The FACS would also assist school counselors to help students. The Facial Action Coding System has the potiential to change the future and how people view schools.    ",4
AAATRP14318000940207,"Is the use of technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom good or not. I personally think that it will be good because I see no real down side, beside invading there personal space. This will not be as helpful right now but in the future this is going to be the next best thing. This might even be put into video recording apps and social media, like Snapchat. Here are my reasons why it should be in school.

Those are reasons in the real world but the question asks if it would be valuable in a classroom. If you can see that a kid is truely upset then you can talk to them before any tragies happen like school shootings and suicides. Also as the story said """"A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"" Dr. Huang predicts. ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."""". This pretty much means when robots take over every job, which they are going to do, They could be even better then human teacher seeing if the class needs help on a certain kind of material, they can work harder on it or change the material. Also the Robo-Teachers can try to make the class more funner when every body is sad.

I think that that code will make robotic teachers more useful and effective. This technology can model and improve the future of america. God bless the U.S.A. Even tho this guy is not in America i dont think. This is why we need Facial Action Coding in our computers.",3
AAATRP14318000917352,"Have you ever felt something and you don't know what you're feeling or why you're feeling that way? New computer technology based around FACS (facial Action Coding System) created by Dr. Paul Eckman can read your emotions. I know you might be asking yourself, ""why would I want that?"" but allow me to further introduce you to this program and why it's such a good idea.

First let me ask you, what harm would it honestly do? Why wouldn't you want this software? I understand that it might sound silly and that technology is really getting ahead of time but it's truely a brilliant idea. The program can single-handedly understand any of your six emotions. This includes, happiness, surprise, anger, fear, sadness and disgust. It completes these tasks by recognizing facial muscles and how they move to create these emotions.

This software might also be able to help people have a better understanding of friends emotions and how to make their peers and friends feel better. The program after identifying your emotions, finds ways to up your mood a little. The article states; ""For example, if you smile when a web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different."" If someone didn't want to have this software, they might as well be saying they don't want to be happy!

The computer software can also identify mixed emotions, such as the example they gave of Mona Lisa stating; ""She's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry."" This is ideal, contrary to the idea that someone might only be feeling one emotion at the time, as it is unlikely. If these computers can find a way to make people happy or to make people smile, the world could be a better place. The software could help other people understand feelings and emotions better and allow for more emotion-realted communication to take action. Why would anyone turn this awesome opportunity down?

If you have experienced feeling emotions and not understanding why or what you're feeling, this software is for you. Even if you haven't experienced this, this softwear could be the reason you smile and if that isn't in your interests,

you should rethink. Overall, there is no down-side to this program. It can tell what you're feeling by your 44 major muscles located in your face. It can also sense your mixed emotions as well. Everyone needs something in their life to help cheer them up and this is the fix to that problem.               ",4
AAATRP14318000886678,"I am against of using the new technology software to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom because I think it doesn't really matter to know how the students' emotions are unless they are getting work done and participating then its fine but other than that I disagree on having this technology to be used on students to know there emotions. If a student is feeling down you would really notice by their participation in the classroom and their facial expression if the student is into anything but if not why is it so important to just look real quick on the software of how the students emotional expression is? This new software thing is really cool and interesting in some way because its great how someone is able to create technology software to see how someone really feels when they are taking a picture if their "" happy, sad,angry,exhausted"" that's very interesting to find out,but i only think its not really a big of a deal to even to study it on students. So I strongly disagree to this option. I also would like to add I think it would be interesting for students to use as an essay in class for like a history class to do a project like this for any assignment because its very interesting to see examples as Mona Lisa really felt the day they took these photographs that made the picture so famous:how did they really feel. It would be a very enjoyable assignment for students to do.",2
AAATRP14318000833281,The technology that is being deveolped is valuable because in situations wehn someone doesnt want to talk or refuse to in a crisis they can read ther emotions and seek a better way of talking with them. also a lot of schools do a horrible almost a illegal jobs and reading kids emotions and helping there students so if this technology was used in schools teachers might actually have a chance at doing there jobs which they need to get better soon. this topic is useful in a lot of ways hostage situations interagations helping disabled people in schools which we all know need help this program could do wonders for people but if they use it to much and make it to logical we could lose sight of how to properly use it to many rules treating to many people the same would destory it because everyones different even if they feel the same way as other people some have a chip on ther shoulder and others own the world to many differences to make this system properly work and functio in a way we all wish it could but it would be to complex and overcompilcated might be a fun app on your phone but not for statewide adminastraion use it would be corrupt and wrong it would only be used to hurt not help ,2
AAATRP14318000823305,"This new technology is very useful to find peoples emotions or even to what they're thinking about. But also it can be very bad to read other peoples emotions because it can become very personal. I say this because what if a kid is having a bad day in the class room and you read their emotions or even thoughts, it can be very rude. An example would be what if some kid was aving some hard times at home before they went to school and they're thinking about what happened the night before they went to school or what will happen to them when they go home from school. But this new technology can be very helpful because what if that student is struggling in their classes and they're too shy to say anything or to get any help. It can be very stressful and may lead to the student to want to just shut down and shut anyone out. But if you had this tachnology in the classroom it can help the student, becausse then the teacher will know that there is something wrong and try to help the student out with his or her problems in a different way like in tuduring only that select student. Or the teacher could go up to the student and figure out what's wrong and persude the student to be more open and talk about what all is wrong.

The people that make them can make computer software that is so high tech that soon enough we won't even need people anymore to do things. we can just buy a robot or a computer with correct software and have it programed for us to use it as a personal assistant.

Computers today help with so many things, they help with orginaizatiion, work, school, etc... The computers in the next generation are most likely going to be very smart because by the next generation comes along the software and programming will be much more stronger than it is today.

The technology we use today is able to tell how you are feeling with just alook at your face. They have made the software so updated that we can tell that. We never woul;d have been able to do that back in the 1900s. They didnt even have computers until the 1970s.

""Then it could modify the lesson, like and effective human instructor"". Secondly i really like this idea because a computer can structure a 3-D model of your face and move your cheek bones to make you smile, squint your eyes, and show teeth also when your angry move your eyebrows, close your lips things like that ""Eckman has classified six basic emotions happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness- and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscle. For example above your eyes, raise your eyebrows when you're surprised, around your mouth tightens your lips to show anger"". Finally this can be very valuable for teachers in the future because teachers can use that computer that reads emotional expressions on his/ her students to see their facial expression and tell what they are feeling this could help the teacher by making her class less boring, doing more avtivities, explaining more the lesson so students can understand and be less confused ""you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face. Of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, ect"". This shows that technology is coming more advanced each year and it will be improving also technology can help in alot of things that could be very benificial for some people and other things like construction, health, school and information.

By the way, did making happy face is the experiment also make you feel slightly happy? He ask.

In resume, your muscle of your face, not only we can see your emotions, they produce the emotions.

Yes it is a great advancement in our technology but what would be the point of using one for a classroom.

I am against the value of using FACS, simply because I do not find the point of using this in a classroom, I feel it could even be a distraction. The Facial Action Coding System will not help a student figure out how to solve a math equation, or tutor a student if one is struggling. Yes this new development is very fascinating and spectacular but what if students use all of their class time on this system instead of taking notes, or studying. In the article the author tells us that the system only looks at your facial muscles. The author himself gives us information about facial muscles, but not once did the author say the system gives you information about the facial muscles, not once did it say anything about helping students learn.

In the second body paragraph of this article the author aksed a question, he asks "" Can we actually calculate emotions like math homework?"" Some could say or think this system is showing how to calculate math problems ,and some could or will assume that the author will answer that question later on in the article. But the author had a different meaning of "" calculation"",it wasn't solving a math problem. The meaning of calculation to the author in this story was to solve someones emotions. Why would somebody need to figure out someones emotion in a classroom, how could that help a struggling student? How could that help a teacher while teaching? Cell phones could educate students more than this system but most schools do not allow phones to be used during the school day.

In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" the author Nick D'Alto tells us about an outstanding development in technology and what it can do, but I do not feel that it is a valuable to a classroom. I feel that it would be more of a distraction,if the system did a little more things to educate and help the students of a classroom learn then this would be very valuable. ",3
AAATRP14318000639846,"Imagine being able to detect how your loved ones are feeling, even when they are trying to hide their emotions. New software has been developed that improves accuracy in perceiving the emotions of others. This new software, the Facial Action Coding System, has promising applications for a variety of industries.

This new technology can help others in so many ways.

One Reason is a person's emotional state. Suicides are major

problem in our world today. Victims are usually hiding their emotions to avoid being detected for their feelings. This technology can find out their emotions by using a 3-D model of the human face; all 44 muscles in the model must move like human muscles. FACS(Facial Action Coding System) then can help guardians or anyone get help the victim needs.

Another reason FACS is useful is the lovely world of education.

Students go through school lost or angry for not being able to click on to the lesson being teached. This system of technology can tell if a student is confused in a certain or many topics. Many students are builled for saying they need help or they dont understand what is being taught. The teachers can use FACS to look at the students face and see if the student needs to be explained the lesson over in class or privately.

My final reason I support FACS is in the courtroom. When justice needs to be served it comes down to the jury to decide cases such as murder,rape and other criminal actions. Poylographs (detection tests) are the common tool used to determine if the alleged is innocent or guilty. Polyographs are known to fail,causing the innocent behind bars or the guilty running free. FACS can scan the emotions of the alleged to see if they feel empathy or if they are guilty.                                          ",3

When looking at a picture of someone smiling, you may think they're happy. Although they're smiling, that smile could surely be fake. What if they threw the smile on so people would think that they're okay? Maybe they just dont want to be bothered. You can't always trust what it is, that your eye is seeing. With this technology, you don't have to trust your eyes to tell how the person in this work of art is feeling. With a few simple steps, you can tell what the emotions in the paintings are. ""The Mona Lisa demonstration is really intended to bring a smile to your face, while it shows just how mcuh this computer can do. Imagine a computer that knows when you are happy or sad"".

This new technology helps us better understand what it is that we are looking at. This Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions. The Facial Action Coding System gathers what muscular action units are being used. The muscular action units is how the Coding System collects its data and registers what it is the person is feeling. ""They even indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one"".

Whether it's a family picture you're looking at, or a painting by the greatest painter of all time, If it makes you happy, hinting a genuine smile, can reflect on how you feel. If you know that a painting of sunflowers, is something that you like to see, can cheer you up a little. Although you're not going to be the happiest person in the world because you looked at a picture/painting you enjoy seeing, you will for sure be more happy!

So this new technology will keep the teacher up to date on how there students or feeling about the lessons.

Some students assume it is easier to just not say anything at all when they dont understand something. Students dont want to be a hassle for the teachers to have to go back and go over a lesson so they end up not saying anyhting on there confusion. Also students just do not want to be the only classmate to speak up. Dr. Huang says "" A clasroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" This can help the teacher in order to realize what they can do to make the lesson more fun like helping the students engage more.

Using technology to read students emotional expressions during class will be very beneficial to the teacher and students.

AAATRP14318000364302,"FACS: the Facial Action Coding System, or possibly the future of teaching. FACS can use all fourty-four major muscles of a face model from a computer to classify how a person is feeling based on six basic emotions. Those six emotions are happiness, anger, disgust, fear, suprise, and sadness. This has major potential to be used anywhere, but the best place could be the classroom. FACS should be used in a classroom because it can read a person's emotions, and could change a lesson if students are bored or confused over a less.

FACS was used on the famous Mona Lisa and produced some very interesting results. It stated that ""She's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry."" That is the true emotion of Mona Lisa according to a computer. But Professor Thomas Huang, of the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science at Illinois University, belives that this could be used for more than just reading the emotion of people in paintings. He and Professor Nicu Sebe of the University of Amsterdam think that the software can be used on the classroom.

First, we need to know how does FACS work. Dr. Huang uses the computer to construct a 3-D model of the face. If movement at one or more of the fourty-four major muscles in the model occurs, that is called an ""action unit."" Dr. Huang then uses the work of psychologists to take it one step further. Dr. Paul Eckman is one the psychologists work used as he is the creator of FACS. Eckman classified six emotions, and then associated each with movements of facial muscles, such as ""your frontalis pars lateralis muscle (above your eyes) raises your eyebrows when you're suprised."" But Dr. Huang knows the true potential of FACS, the classroom.

A classroom computer with the FACS software could read the emotions of kids in a classroom. It then could change up a lesson if most students are bored or confused. Lets say a student or multiple students aren't understanding a lesson very well from the notes and is confused. The computer could create a game to play that not only makes students excited, but helps them understand the lesson more. This could be crucial towards the future of education.

FACS could become the next teacher assistant for a classroom and succeed at a high standard. The system could lead to better grades for students and lead to a higher graduation rate at universities. This is just the beginning of FACS, and the future only gets better for something as powerful as this.

AAATRP14318000325515,"The use of this technology is not useful because this really wouldn't be a good investment and not helpful in a learning enviornment. people might also find it as an invations of their privacy using it in class. The money can be spend towards a better education system and allowing our schools to get proper funding for what is needed. It wouldn't be helpful due to the fact that there is no real need for this technology when we could spend in other programs.

The money that is put into this for detecting emotions out of a straight face, but this can be considered as an invasion of privacy. This really isn't useful much due to the fact that it will try and read your thoughts practically. Even though it would be fun to see what someones mood is on a straight face, it be more of a burdon to have and wouldn't serve a major purpose in the learning enviornment. The only real reason to use it is if you were to test to see if someone was lying about a topic.

The money to invest into these machines would be costly and hard to afford for the schools that would need to buy it. This would cause the fundings for supplies maintence and learning programs to go down and would be difficult to run the school properly. This wouldn't be effective having it in the classrooms because of the software and the risk of kids possibly messing it up cause the school to fix or replace the machine. Schools already are getting budget cuts from the government so they have to ration and shorten supply due to money cost. These new machines would take up too much of the school budget.

The counter claim it that these new tools can be used to help aid with children and behavior, and allow students to be more honest with one another. This can also help the teacher see if one student is hiding something. The teacher can use the information from the software and help dicipline the students if need be. Teachers can also see if students are cheating or are lying to them and can be able to organize the class with it's help. These can be good but this new machine can invade on personal privacy and wll not help much other than dicipline.

The main thing to see is that this machine can be useful in some categories but wil not be of much benefit. This technology wouldn't be useful due to the fact that this sytem would cost more and would be invasive on the children. The schools would be more better off focusing on supplies and equipment to further imporve the school and learning.",4
AAATRP14318000236236,"The article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" describes a new technology that can depict the emotions of anyone simply based off of their facial expressions. The technology, created by Dr. Huang, can calculate the percent of different emotions that a face is conveying. The technology could possibly be effective in classrooms, but people are not sure how truly effective the system would be. Some people believe the system would be useless, while others believe the system could bring a new view to learning. In my opinion, The Facial Action Coding System produced by Dr. Huang would be valuable in the classroom because of the many benefits it could bring to learning.

Beginning In pagraph 6, D'Alto describes the benefits of what the system can bring to the classroom. D'Alto includes a quote from Dr. Huang that states, ""'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,' Dr. Huang predicts. 'Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor'"" (D'Alto). This quote reveals that the system could advance the concept of learning. The system could allow students to stay more engaged in their lessons and not doze off or sit in confusion. The technology could allow students to enjoy learning more and could make school a less stressful environment. The modified lessons would allow students to have a learning experience that fits their knowledge and capabilities and would advance them in their experience of learning. The evidence provided in the article shows the true effectiveness the technology could have in the classroom.

The Facial Coding System produced by Dr.Huang is revolutionary. However, the possible effectiveness of the technology in the classroom is pondered by many. Overall, I believe the technology would be valuable in the classroom because of the many benefits it could bring to the capabilities of learning.",3
AAAOPP13416000238150,"Can you imagine a time in the fututre wheen on one buy cars because no one needs them anymore? I can imagine a world when car's do all the driving. The world would be much safer and driving would become much easier. Imagine a day when you won't have to worry about driving ever again. Driving would become easier to trucker's, drunks, and you.

Trucker's are one of America's finest ways to transport good and foods all over our country. Most of these trucker drive non-stop once they get on the road. Some of them get into accidents because they got so tired on the road that they just pass out. Imagine the trucker's real tired and all he had to do was push a button that would make the car drive by itself. Not only would that save time ,but it would also save lives.

Most drivers died in car accident because either their drunk or they got hit by a drunk driver. Most of these drunken driver are to hung over to care what happens to themselves and others. They get in the car thinking their sobber egnouh to get home but, they never do get home because they got hit a tree or run into a simitruck. Wait ,this could all be avoided if all they had to do was push a simple button and say their address or house. This could invention could save million lives a year.

Now, most importantly you. Your late for work and theirs people blowing up your phone and your baby's crying. Don't you wish that your car could just drive itself for a minute? Well your in luck because we already have some car's like this. In the future these cars well be much more advance than we could ever think.

Now we still have a long way to go with the driveless cars. And it's not going to be easy either stated in pargraph nine.Most of these cars will have to understand how to drive when theres a accident ahead or when there construtions. But just like what pargraph ten said,""we grow closer to our destinations everyday.        ",3
AAAOPP13416000218528,"Although driverless cars have both positive and negative aspects my postion on rather they should or should'nt become a reality is that driverless cars should'nt become a reality. The reason that even as they are develping driverless cars now they can not be tuely driverless. Also the manufactors of the car car didn't nescerly want smart cars they wanted smarter roads. Another reason is that they have only been able to engernieer parts of a driverless car that still need human assistance. Lastly there are still major concerns for the passagers of the driverless cars.

Even though driverless car parts have been put in to newer car models the cars are still mainly controled by drivers. for example in 2013 BMW announced their ""traffic jam assistant"" , but the car only could stop the car if it was 25mph or lower meaning the driver would have to try to stop on their on. another example is that in the 1980's automakers sed speed sensors at the wheels in creation of the antilock brakes, but it tok them ten years to perfect them. whose to say that if the release the self driving car to eraly it won't cause many acidents.

In the 1950's Gerneral motors created a concept car that could run on a special track leading to to thought of smart roads. The trought of smart car was an accident because they knew smart roads was'nt possible. the automaker didnt think cars could get much smarter and didn't know how much smart they need to be. the idea was later pick up in 2009 because the knew that it was no way it could happen before the 2000's.

they have a big pogress on the devolpment of the driverless car but is thought to be known that they could never be tuely driverless. the driverles car made in 2009 is said to be driverless but is not because is is alway a drriver in the car that has to pull into an out od driveways and parking lots. Also the driver is to to always remain alert because they may have to take over incase of technological falier or emergency. so that is let people know that it can fail at any time.

There is also the big safey corncern and legal side of the driverless car. the law beleive that the saest car is one driven and controlled by a human. Most states won't even allow the testing of theses cars. Another issue is who          ",3
AAAOPP13416000216889,"I am Dr.Monroe, a scientist here at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. Otherwise known as NASA. A very popular space agency. Twenty five years ago something very odd happened around around Mars. We had one of our spacecrafts (Viking 1) circling mars, and taking pictures of possible landing sites for another one of our spacecrafts (Viking 2). Later on, we found that Viking 1 had snapped a picture of what seemed to look like a human face. We were very excited to find out what this new finding was, but we later found out that it was just a Martian mesa. Very common around Cydonia. Only this particular mesa had very outrageuos shadows, that made it look like a face.

Though we have stated before to the world that this was just a Martian mesa, some people thought otherwise. For example, one day I was sitting at a coffe shop nearby where I worked with my labcoat on. On my labcoat, it stated my name, and in big letters, the word: NASA. Like I was saying, I was in a coffe shop nearby where I worked, and was suddenly approached by a young man in his twenties. He stood there for a while making sure that I acknowledged him. When I did finally notice him, he smiled, and said that his name was Stan. He told me that he noticed my labcoat and where I worked, and wanted to bring up the topic ""The Face"". I chuckled at his comment, and agreed to discuss the topic.

He sat down in the chair across from me, and we started talking. He brought up how he thought that we were hiding something to do with the face. I kindly replied that we weren't, and that we explained to all the news stories, and talkshows, that this ""face"", was just a simple Martian mesa. Even when I said this, he disregarded it, and continued speaking about how he thought that this picture of ""the Mesa"" was proof of extraterestrial life on mars. as soon as he said this I burst out with laughter. Tears were falling from my eyes, as I thought this was a joke. but, when i saw that he was serious, I immediatley stopped laughing, and apologized. i explained to him that the picture of what he thought was a face, really was just ""the Martian equilavent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American west"". At this time he then grabbed something from out of his satchel (which i hadn't noticed before) which looked like a picture of some sort. As a took a closer look, i saw that this was actually three pictures on one page.

The pictures that he showed me were pictures of "" The Face"" in chronological order from 1976 to 2001. He then said to me that that it was possible for alien markings to be hidden. I peered at him with a strange face trying to figure out why this was so important to him, but i answered his question. I stated that ""The Face on mars was located at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter in April '98- a cloudy time of the year on the red planet"". even after this was said he shook his head with a tiny smirk on his face. I then grew annoyed at him and then pointed to the third picture taken in 2001. "" Do you see here?"" ""In image three we used a digital image three times bigger than the pixel size. If there were anything else on this landform other than rocks such as alien markings, you would've seen it already."" He stared at me with a look of stupidity on his face as i then had a smirk on my face. I was proud of myself for proving him wrong.

After our little argument, he quietly got up from his seat, shook my hand, said nice to meet you, and walked out of the coffe shop. I then realized the time and walked out as well, and went back to work.",3
AAAOPP13416000147650,My argument on the article Driverless Cars Are Coming is that we should have them because they could be very useful in the near future because there are some people that like to drive very fast and there are some people that like to drive to slow. So i think by making a driverless car could be in are intrest because it could stop some of these traffic laws we have. Its also a good thing that if there is a crash while your in the driverless car the human can take control of the wheel and get out of the situation. Another good factor is they put a laser beams to form a constantly updating 3-D model of the cars surrounding. The combination of all this input is necessary for the driverless car to mimic the skill of a human at the wheel. I think the only bad factor in the driverless car is if the human is to slow to react in time of the crash to prevent it from happenning. I think this driverless car could actually save lives because humans dont go by the speed limit now a days. Even with drunk drivers this driverless car could save there lives and the people on the street lives because drunk drivers cant drive but always try to drive this driverless car could save there lives for 1 mistake that the humans always make. This car could be the reason we dont have anymore accidents on the streets. Another bad factor of having this driverless car is that some people like to drive and cruse around and some people like to go a certain speed because they like the rush. But the only reason why im for the driverless car is because in my opinion i think its more safe and i think that it will keep much more people out of trouble with the law because the driverless car wll follow the laws of the street. The only thing that will be risky is trusting the manufacturers we go to put all our trust in there hands and hope that they can make the driverless car the best it can be.  ,3
AAAOPP13416000147157,"Can you imagine a time in the future when no one buys cars because no one needs them anymore ? Well no I can't really imagine a time in the future when no one buys cars because no one needs them anymore . I can't imagine that because theres always gonna be a time where you need to go somewhere & your gonna need transportation to get you there . If there were no cars in the future so many lives would be so miserable because who would wanna walk everywhere they need to go? I know I would get tired of walking . There's so many places where people need to be on time but only with some kind kind of transpotation . Life wouldn't be so great without cars because just even walking the house or even to go down the street for something important would really get annoying & tired .

When reading paragraph 7 it talks about how BMW announced the development of ''Traffic Jam Assistant in 2013. Well just because there were alot of ""Trafic Jams'' in 2013 doesn't mean just think about the future without any cars . We need transpotation everywhere we go. I know that there's many of ways for transportation but walking , I don't think that's really a great idea knowing that we walk 24/7 365 days out of the whole year . Having a car & knowing that you can drive it around anytime you would like to is actually good , because even though the gas that you put in your car goes up a dollar or 2 every week doesn't just give up or think about not having cars in the future. There are teenagers all over the world that are looking foward to getting them a car when they get older & even teens and adults now that are wishing that they could get them a car.

My position on driveless cars is that what is a driveless car if you still need a driver to drive the car ? You will always need someone to drive the car even if it is a driveless car. There are car crashes everywhere you go , but you can always fix that problem by sharing the road with the other drives . Watching out for other drivers and the people that are walking is a big step of getting behind the wheel . Making sure that there aren't other people in the way so that you will not hit them & even following the rules of the road , like making sure that you stop at STOP signs & even waiting for your turn to turn while driving. There's no need to imagine a time in the future when no one buys cars because no one needs them anymore.   ",1

Car companies are making cars smarter and cars would be able to drive themselves. Driverless cars are effiecent because the driver doesnt need to drive all the time, there would be less accidents.

Drives won't need to drive all the time now. There are some people who just dont know how to drive and are better off not driving. In the article it said "" The Google car simply announces when the driver should be prepared to take over."" This shows that drivers would still need to drive the car but not all the time. Sometimes drivers need to get somewhere but dont go because they dont want to drive. They won't have to becuase they might drive for a little bit or maybe nothing at all.

There would be less accients if cars can be driven themselves. In the article it said "" their cars have been driven more than half a million miles without a crash.""

This shows that their cars so far have not gotten into an accient for a while. People who have cars tnd to crash many times because some drivers are just not careful. The roads would be more calm and safe. It is just better for everyone.

Car companies should make driverless are becuase people wont need to drive all the time espicially when thehy go somewhere far, and there would be less car accidents which also include less deaths.

AAAOPP13416000110312,"The ""Face"" is just a natural landform. The ""Face"" was not created by the aliens. NASA, took picutres three diffenernt times and in threee different years.

The ""Face"" is just a natural landform. In 1976, the Viking 1, took a photo of ""the Face"". When we got the picture it did look suspicous, it did look like a face, In paragrapgh 2, we did say it looked like a Egyptian Pharaoh. Everybody was crazy over it, when we posted the picture for everyone could see. A few of the scientists did believe that it was a alien artifact. But not a lot of them believed that. In paragragh 6, it became a priority for NASA, when Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) arrived at the Red Planet, eighteen years after the Viking mission ended. We decided we were going to take a good photo of ""the Face"" once we got a good shot at it, we felt it was important to the taxpayers.

In paragraph 7. On April 5, 1988, wheb MGS flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Obiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the orginial Viking pictures. Thousand of Web surfers found out it was just a natural landform. But, it was winter, so some people thought alien marking were hidding by the haze, becuase there was a wispy cloud.

We decided to try again. In paragraph 10, on April 8, 2001, a cloudless summer in Cydonia, MGS drew close enough for a second look on ""the Face"". We took the picture, and the camera we used, ""Had a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size, so if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"" says Garvin.

In conclusion, on paragraph 12, what the picture actually showed

was equivalent to a butte or a mesa. It looked like a common landform around the American West. ""It reminds me most of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,"" says Garvin. It did not look like a alien artifact, or some markings from aliens. It was just a noraml landform, that only looked like a face, because the camera back in the day, are not as good as today's camera. So now, we can actually see if it looks like a face or not,

AAAOPP13416000108072,"The driverless cars are coming. This is the most greatest news ever. For technology and cars lovers and especially lazy people this is. But not just does people everyone generally. The world will love to nver have to drive a car again.

I am for the aspects of driveless cars. They are many reasons for my decision. In paragraph 1, cofounder of Google Sergey Brin states that he believe such cars would fundementally change the world. And Google has had cars that drive indepedantly since 2009. In paragraph 2, it says ""Their cars have driven more than half a million miles without a crash."" Which means that the car actually works. I honestly doubt that a human can drive half a million miles without a single crash. But these developements for self driving cars was also back in the day. For example, in the late 1950s General Motors did radio signals. That read the posotive and negative polarity as messages in binary code. It also worked supringly well. Since the late 1950s to now we are still using sensors. Google and many other company's have modified and develloped automotive sensors. In the newer models of cars we have cameras that assist us. We have raidar signal and GPS receivers. These developments and new technology are catching up and will go further.

For now law is the major issue but soon they will be new laws added. These new laws will support this great new modern technology. In paragraph 10 it states ""Automakers are continuing their work on the assumption that problems ahead will be solved."" and also the final sentence ""But we ggrow closer to the destination everyday."" And that is true, this is a great ideas and technology that we can't just let pass by us. Driverless cars are the futurtre and they are coming.",2

There is an up side and down side to driverless cars. There is quite a few up sides to them, and not as many downfalls. The Google Car has drove over a half of a million miles without a crash. These cars are not completely driverless which kind of defeats the purpose of having a driverless car. And honestly I myself would not drive one of these cars because I enjoy driving.

The legal side of driverless cars is going to be the hard part. The companies that make the cars would have to pay millions of dollars to people who got injured because of electronic malfunctions. On the flip side of things, they would make millions off of these cars. The laws on who could have these cars and where they can be driven is going to be a tough discussion as well. BMW claims their car can drive its self up to 25 mph, but I feel like there would be a lot of testing and using of the car before changing these laws. ",2

In my honest opinion I hate the ideal so much. I think we shouldnt aproach this because, It takes away the joy of being able to drive, its going to be way to expensive to make these things happen, and Driverless cars are the least of our worries.

I think that we should not aproach the idea of driverless cars because it takes away the joy of being able to drive a car. Like honestly I grew up anxious for the moment I walk out of the BMV with my drivers liscence, ready to drive my very own car. I layed awake dreaming about the nights I could go to the country and cruise while I listen to music, and race my buddies. Now that im getting older and everyone is trying to advance technology so much, and so fast to the point when I get my liscence I wont even be driving my car. ""Mercedes-benz, Audi, and Nissan plan to have cars that can drive themselves by 2020"". In my eyes that is ridicoulus, i want to be able to drive my won car , and hear the engine as I do it.

I think that we shouldnt approach this beacuse its going to be way to expensive to make this happen. All the word wants to do is advance the things that do not need advanced.

we are trillions of dollars in debt to other nations, and instead of paying them back they want to blow billions on uneccisary things. They wouod have to make roads special for these things to happen. ""They required massive upgrades to existing roads, something that was simply to expensive to be practical"". This is a prime example on why we shouldnt do these kind of things, and its showing everyone how much time America waists on dumb things.

The last reason on why I think we should not aproach this is because driverless cars are the least of our worries. If you really think about it, all this time companies are wasting on things like new technology we could actually be bettering the earth. Instead of taking so much effort and money to make new cool things for us, we should help clean the earth. We are destroying the habitats of the wildlife we dont pay attention. We should worry more about not destroying our home, and not worry about making futuristic cars that are gonna cost a furtune and wast your time.

I think we shouldnt approach this beacuse it takes away the joy of getting a liscence, it way to expensive to make these things happen, driverless cars are the least of our worries.

This phenonim is about a small land form on the suface of Mars that takes the look of a face. There a million hypothesis of what it could be, but we have found what it really is. With research we found a logical reson to how we are correct. Some think its from aliens, and some think its just a natural land form but what is it?

Incase you have not heard the ""face"" has been spotted on Mars, a small landform with some facial features that make it look like one. But a face from an allien, that sounds, and is unlogical. We have done so much reasarch towards this landform. Shadows give it the look of a face, and thats why we can only see it sometimes. In fact mission controllers even said you had to capture it at the correct lighting. But, if it were a real face, you could see it anytime.

In fact we have logical evedience, there are gigantic storms which would have wiped all the alliens out. They would be burried way benith the suface, becuase when Mars has a storm its vicious, and moves dust, dirt, and sediment all over. If there even was alliens they would be covered in hunderds of pounds of dust.

Yet I can see the opposing side saying that since the dust moves around so much how come the bodies couldnt be revealed? This is hundreds of pounds of dust ontop of them. Even though the dust moves so much, there a 1 and a million chnace of it moving above 400 pounds of dust.

In conclusion, this phenomim gives NASA the attention it wants, but its not true. While some might think there was alliens were on Mars, its illogical for their heads to just appear. Even though the opposers think its possible, they are dead and cannot move. Therefore the face is just a landform with shadows that make it look like a face. It it were a face we could see it anytime, but there was lots of research needed to conclude this. Therefore sayin its just a landform.    ",3
AAAOPP13416000100742,"As technolgy begins to improve more and more everyday and grow into something larger, driveless cars seem to be next on the line. The idea of driveless cars may sound like something great, but in reality its not. Driveless cars are just next on the line to something that's luxurious but in reality very dangerous.

The idea of driveless cars has been brought up since around the 1950s. Since then many automotive companies have tried to come up with cars that drive themselves but have stragetically failed due to need of other devices or simply just a failed test drive.

Smart cars would seem like the next big thing, but only the next big thing for most caused accidents. Even with people driving many accidents are caused, now imagine having a driveless car the could glich at any given moment. Sure these cars include sensors and cameras that would alert the driver, but once the car doesn't now what to do its time for the ""driver"" to take over.

These driveless cars are said to be the next big in the future, they are thought to be used as taxi's and many other methods of transportation. They are said to reduce the amount of gas being used which would lower pollution which is great, but what other things would it cause, there has to be an alternative for that. Driveless cars are expensive cars, well that is in the of manufacturing. It has been a long process creating some of these because since then not all gadgets have been made or updated to create the high technology cars. BMV has a ""Trafic Jam Assistant"" but it functions only up to 25 mph. Road limits are well above 25 mph, we need cars that are able to go up 70, 80, 90 even 100 mph.

While the driveless cars are said to be the most safe vehicle, what would happen in case of an accident? If techonology fails someone could become injured, but would it be the drivers fault or the manufactures fault in lack of design. All these situations would just have to result in new laws being made.

Driveless cars should be kept out of roads. They would be ideal for experimenting with or playing around with, but they shouldn't be allowed to be driven out on roads. It is even illegal to test drive computer operated cars in most of the country, such as those that would be used in the future. California, Nevada, Florida and the District of Colombia have been an exception to this, but other states wait to follow the cars until they are proved to be more reliably safe. ",2

If you look at paragraph eight and you can see that aat the begging that it says the ""Face"" is locatedd 41 degrees north. But also if you look it says they found it on a cloudy days on mars. So they may not know for sure it still looks like a face. It has been 15 years since they have looked at the face, so the thing may not be there still.

First of all there has not been any factual proof that aliens exist or have even existed. Earth even has strange and unusual landformations that seem unreal. There have been countless unusual discoveries that people have twisted the story around and made people believe another thing for example like how some people think that the face is a alien artifact. Also conspiracy theorists claim that the face is bona fide evidence of life on mars, But there is no proof that life could even form on mars.

To proove that it was nothing more than a natural landform the artice states ""Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh"". Also ""thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the first image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing... a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all"". The article also states ""what the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West"".

Coming to the resolution that aliens really didn't have anything to do with the face on Mars. We have proven that the images taken of the face can help us see in perspective and tell that the face was just a natural landform just like the ones that Earth has.",2

AAAOPP13416000064618,"If you think the Face on Mars was created by aliens, you're out of your mind. Aliens didn't create the Face, it's just a huge rock formation. In fact, the Face is just a natural landform.

The Face was photographed with a high quality camera that could make images 3 times bigger than the pixel size. So if there were other objects created by aliens, you'd be able to see them. If the Face was really created by aliens, there should be more objects to prove that, and not just the Face.

The picture of the Face is very similar to the Middle Butte located in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. Garvin says it's about the same height as the Face on Mars, which shows that the Face is a natural landform like the Middle Butte.

When the picture of the Face was posted on a JPL web site, it revealed a natural landform. Many people believed there was no alien monument after all.

So in conclusion, there are many reasons why the Face is a natural landform. The theory of the Face being created by aliens is inaccurate. ",3
AAAOPP13416000061637,"The Face on Mars is a mystery of how it was created. Know one knows how it was made, if it was created by aliens or just a natural landform. People may think that since it is in space it has to do with aliens in some possible way. Scientist Jim Garvin discovered a landform similar to the Face on Mars. The Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. It is a lava dome that takes the shape of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars. They also have discovered that the surveyor has labeled it a natural landform. The Face on Mars is catergorized as a mesa which is around the American West. Could the Face on Mars be a natural landform?

The similar land form in Idaho has the same height as the Face on Mars. The pictures that they have captured shows the martian equivalent of a butte or mesa. If this was a alien type of act the MGS would have seen the alien's shelters, airplanes, and pyramids. The Face on Mars is not a alien' s sculpture. NASA's surveyor had labeled the face as a natural landform. The surveyor catergorized it as a natural landform because it didn't pick up any traces of alien activity. Also, if NASA wasn't forsure about their discovery they woudn't have posted it on websites or annonced it to the world. They said that they would have rathered kept this information classified. Why would you put a false statement on the internet, expecially if it involved aliens, because then the world would be going crazy. They would be preparing for them to attack and abduct people.

I could understand why some people could believe that aliens made up this rock like object. One of the most obvious reasons is that it is space. On the day when they wanted to take another picture it was very cloudy and you couldn't see the face, which some believe that aliens had hid the face by a haze. But, we haven't had any discoveries or theroies of there being aliens in this galaxy.

In conclusion, the Face on Mars is a natural landform that was not created by aliens.              ",4
AAAOPP13416000053101,"There's a face on Mars! Just kidding its a buttle or mesa landform. In 1976 NASA has sent Viking 1 spacecraft was snapping photos of possible landing sites for its sister ship Viking 2. when it spotted the shadowy likeness of a humans face. Couple days later NASA unveiled the image for all to see. The face on Mars has since become a pop icon. Some scientists believed the face was an alien artifact.

On April 5, 1998 when MGS flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars orbiter Camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Revealing a natural landform. there is no alien monument after all. Some people was not satisfied because they wanted to believe it was an actually alien artifact. But no, the MGS had to go take another photo to prove its a landform.

Some people ain't satisfied because they think the camera didnt get a good enough pictures of the alien markings cause they were hidden by haze. Everyone is wishing its alien face on Mars but instead they are getting a landform. Gravin says that they dont pass over the face very often because its not easy to find Cydonia.

On April 8, 2001 Malin's team has took another photo of the face. but we all know its a landform. if there were objects in the photo like airplane on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks. The pitures is actually showing you a buttle or mesa landform. So when the MGS said it wasnt a face people got upset and wanting them to take another photo.

So for everyone who is believing thats the face on Mars is wrong. Its a landform common around the American West. ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plian of Idaho. says Garvin. ""Thats a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the face on Mars. So from now on its a landform not a face on Mars. ",3
AAAOPP13416000052131,"You're keeping your eyes on the road, making sure nothing goes wrong, but isn't that what your fancy car is supposed to do for you? You feel as though you're being watched. That's because you are. You're sitting doing nothing bored out of your mind when you could be cruising down the road, feeling the wind in your hair, feeling completely in control. But you're not. At this point in time, driverless cars are more trouble than they are worth. They are also taking away the comfort and safety that drivers today have become accustomed to.

Throughout the years, there have been many attempts and advances made toward the production of driverless cars. These attempt have not been successful thus far. The driverless cars that have been made are not even truly driverless. They still require the attention of a human. One great idea these car manufacturers had was to make smarter roads, but that is something that would take many years and a lot of money that people just don't have. In paragraph 9 of the article, it describes how there would have to be laws written and passed for this all to work out and lawmakers ""know that safety is best achieved with alert drivers."" This shows that lawmakers are not particularly eager to make this happen and without them it won't happen.

Another reason why the project of creating driverless cars should not be continued is that it would be taking away the comfort and safety that drives today are used to. Even though drivers would not be in complete control of the cars they still ""must remain alert and ready to take over when the situation requires."" What is the point of having a driverless car if people are still forced to make sure the car is safe? This might even cause fear among drivers because sometimes people feel safest when they are completely control and they know others are as well, but with driverless cars they would not have that security. Sometimes it's even a comfort to people to be able to cruise down the road knowing they can take themselves anywhere they want to go. Even if they weren't afraid they would at least be bored out of their minds like everyone is on road trips. The article also describes how ""the car watches the driver."" Horror movies and tv shows all have illustrated how much people dislike feeling like they are being watched. Not to mention, there are people out there who can hack the cameras in cars and people would never really be sure that the people watching them have their best interests. In paragraph 9 the article also proposes the issue of possible conflicts arising if someone if injured in said driverless cars. Who would be at fault? This would be yet another issue courts would have to deal with when they already have so much on their plates.

Although there are many reasons why driverless cars should not be produced, there are many positive things that could possibly occur if they did exist. Sergey Brin forsees that half of the fuel used in cars today would be used for these cars and there would be more flexibility than buses, but there is no solid proof. It is very possible that instead of roads being full of buses the roads are cramped with cars and traffic would be unbearable. Also, buses typically use less fuel because they are carrying around people that would have used more fuel in seperate cars. Driverless cars have also been proven to go a million miles without crashing, but did these cars have destinations in highly populated areas with many other driverless cars around them? It's impossible to know for sure that this fact means anything without have the proper conditions accounted for. The article also says that the cars could have built in entertainment systems, but wouldn't that just distract the driver from the road? They are supposed to be ""alert and ready to take over"" at all times.

Overall, the continued research and production of driverless cars would be so much work and money used when there is already a safe system in place. Without driverless cars people won't have to worry about things changing or fear for their safety. They can just contiue to live their lives as they have for years. The article says that safety is the most important thing. If that is true, the world is better off without driverless cars.",5

On April 5, 1998, Mars Global Surveyor, took pictures of the ""red planet"" and proved everyone wrong. The face was just a rock with shadows casting over it making it look like it had facial features just like us humans. If the face was a human's then why can't they see the face all the times they fly over Mars? In the pictures provided you can tell that you can only see the face from a certain angle so where the shadows can cast over the rock formation.

It turns out that it was just a huge rock formation with shadows casting over it to make it look like it had eyes, nose, and a mouth. Malin's team even got a closer look at the face to gather more evidence and to see what else is on the rock formation. The picture they took didn't really show anything except the landscape.           ",2

I will explain to you why it's not an alien. What the face on Mars could possibly be besides an allien. What the artifact is made of, and how I've showed you how it is not real.

There is multiple ways this item is not an alien. One way is in the picture of the artifact is a face like form. Many people think that the aliens have strange faces. Another thing is why, would an alien be inside mars. The way the artifact is coming out of mars the alien couldn't have fallen and face planted. The artifacts face also looks farley close to a humans face.

Well there are many things the artifact could be. One could be is there is a rock coming out of mars that has a face like form. Another thing is that gases could be trapped and pushing it out and have that shape. What if it is like a hill and somthing happened to it. The rover on mars could have possibly done the face look. There are many diffrent things it can be.

The artifact maybe made of many diffrent things. One I'm sure is the sand like material on mars. Another is probably rock formations that have formed on mars. Carvings out of mars have things to do with it I'm sure. I'm sure it had help from gases to help it. There are multiple things that it could be made up of.

Have I got you to think it is not an alien. Yes some, but some no, which is possible with humans. Some people are going to think yes it is real.

Driverless cars could change the way people commute. As driverless cars begin to come in play, less people will have to drive their own car. As many people know, tons people get into accidents everyday because of the people behind the wheel making harmful decisions, if driverless cars were put out on the roads there would be less traffic accidents because there would not be people behind the wheel who are reckless and causing these accidents to occur. Driverless cars alert the drive when needed or when about to come into contact with something therfore these cars will help reduce the effects of human error and give more reaction time to the human in the passenger side.

This could also shorten the amount of people taking the bus to the places they need to go, which would make the polution problem a way less common thing. Also, lots of people with disablities can not drive, with the help of a driverless car those people could get to the places they need to go instead of someone else driving them or them not being able to go at all.

Driverless cars would also just provide convience to the world. Lots of people dread the drive to work everyday or a long drive to Disney, but with driverless cars they would not have to drive there. They could sit and relax and not have to worry about making a traffic accident because of them being tired behind the wheel.

The factories making these cars would need more help. Thus, bringing in more jobs for the people and making the economy stronger. This could also bring in money by the people who want these cars because of the convience of them. Driverless cars could lead to more advancements in technology to help driving become safer which would bring in more money for the economy.

AAAOPP13416000039327,"I believe in driverless cars. Driverless cars are the next big leap into transportation. Throughout the past there has been major leaps in transportation such as aviation, cars and trains. Although its not entirly a new thing it could become the next step to having easyier lives. But would it?

In the artical it states that new laws would have to be made in order to accomidate the driverless vehicals. They would have to change due to the unfortunate event of an accident or a collision. That could all be taken care of in a court of law but as safty issues go, what happens if the car malfunctions on the freeway or innerstate? This could very well happen but I supect that it will be a very rare occurance.

The benifits however outweigh the issues. Just some of the many benifits are less accidents, safer driving condtions, and most likely no traffic. Selfdriving cars don't need a driver so that means more free time for the person woam would have been driving. In the artical it adress the factor of boredom. Stating that entertainment systems would be put into place preventing a passanger from being board. The artical also adresses how states will not allow driverless cars to even be out and about. I suspect when all issues are ironed out and flaws are to a minum those laws will be dead. The only laws that need to be put into place would be if an accident occurs or a colission were to happen. As of traffic there would be a significantly decreased amout due to no accidents,and no random breaking. Not only would they not have accidnets but they would be able to travel at faster speeds and no crash. Meaning that a person would get there safe and faster than they would have been able to.

Finally the benifit of not owning a car. You may not realize it but owning a vehical is very expensive. Some of the expences are fuel, insurance, the actual car, maintence, ect. But if there were driverless cars then it would be just like a taxi servce but with no driver, ariving at the destination faster, and not having to deal with an accident. However that is ways away and selfdriving cars still have quite a ways to go.

All in all I completely agree with having a selfdriving car.

I think it is unnecassary to try to make these driverless cars becuase it could cost a lot, and end up not working out in the long run

First off, in my eyes these driverless cars would just cause more problems for everyday life.

These driverless cars would have trouble getting through complicated areas such as detours, road blocks, parking lots, etc.

And even though there are positive effects for this type of car, I think there are many more negative effects that could put lives at risk, and waste a lot of time getting places.

Do we have the technology to make these driverless cars happen?

Absolutely, but the risk/reward is not worth it in my opinion.

Whats wrong with just hopping in your car and driving it yourself?

""Backseat"" drivers that try to tell the actual drivers what to do are already bad in todays world, just imagine a backseat driver trying to yell at a robot driving their car.

Overall, I think trying to make these driverless cars a reality is not worth the time or money.

It would be much easier and safer to have humans controlling their cars and evaluating the situation through their own eyes to mkae the judgement on what or what not to do.

AAAOPP13416000038896,"Self-driving cars, or driverless cars, have always been argued on wether they are more reliable than the typical driver car. While there are pros and cons to owning a driverless car, there are more faliures that come with it rather than successes.

Driverless cars are always open to accidents. Although there have been limited amounts of accidents involving self-driving cars, the chances are still high. In the text the author states, ""This necessitates the car being ready to quickly get the driver's attention whenever a problem occurs."" This means that whenever a self-driving car approaches an accident, it makes the driver manuever it itself. This can be dangerous to someone who is not paying attention, regardless of it being a self-driving car, that quickly approaches an accident which causes the driver to panic and not do the right manuever. This can cause another accident and can even be deadly.

Self-driving cars are also expensive and hard to perfect. These cars are costly to manufacture, sell, and maintain. They require intriquet parts such as sensors which are very costly. In the article is states, ""...uses position-estimating sensors on the left rear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automotive radar sensors, a GPS reciever, and inertial motion sensor."" All these parts that a single modified Toyota Prius uses is costly. One can only imagine how complex and expensive a real manufactured driverless car would be. The driverless car fields are targeting the upper and middle classes of this economy but how will the average American afford to buy one when they are bound to be expensive luxuries?

Driverless cars also produce conflicts that would occur if a person were to get into an accident with one of the cars. In the article, it states, ""If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault- the driver or the manufacturer?"" This is one of the questions that needs to be answered by the companies before they can produce them. This is a liability to the person involved in the accident because they will have to determine specifically if he/she caused the accident or the car. This can be costly and time consuming.

Cars that can control on themselves take the joy out of physically driving. In the article, it states, "" 'We have to interpret the driving fun in a new way.' "" Driving a car can provide relaxation and joy from being able to control a car, but with a self-driving one, the joy disappear and limitations occurs.

Although there are many people who are opposed to this idea of self-driving cars, there is a majority of people, mostly Millenials, who think this idea is revolutionary. Most of the people who like the idea of self-driving cars think that it provides less room for accidents because the car does the driving for you. Also many who support the idea think that driverless cars will burn less fuel and help the enviroment. There are pros and cons to both, but having the access to self-driving cars would provide to be a failure.

Driverless cars are an advancement to this society. Although revolutionary, these cars have or can make issues such as accidents, lawsuits, complications, limitations, and more. They, most importantly, can take the freedom and joy of riding cars and being able to control them. Driverless cars have more negative aspects rather than positive ones. ",5
AAAOPP13416000038323,"As cars become more involved in the technology world, the roads will become a dependable environment to get from point A to B without risking danger. The develpment of the driverless car is a postive advance in technology because of its ability to create a safe, comfortable and smart environment. With roof and wheel sensors, GPS receivers and in-car entertainment centers, self driving cars will save lives and the death rates of driving will decrease.

Driverlesscars will lower the driving death rates dramatically because of their sensors that detect sudden motion or objects near the veichle. The more the sensors advance, the more they are able to respond to danger in a way that is inhumanly possible. Once danger comes into play such as an out-of-control situation or a sudden skid, humans become less dependable to respond correctly in result of the stress they are put under in the rapid situation. The driverless car's ability to make motions based on its surroundings is a positive advance in the technology world because of how many lives it will save.

Deaths caused by texting and driving will also be reduced because of the entertainment systems the driverless car's manufacturers are installing. The entertainment system's ability to shut down once a driver needs to drive will create a safer environment rather than those who have the abiltity to text and drive in their manual driving cars. The heads-up displays in the driverless cars are an effective way to safe lives because it takes away the purpose of needing a cellphone.

As self driving cars become the norm they will also create a better future for drivers.

Less fuel used could mean less toxic emmissions and a cleaner environment.

You have no evidence to prove your point about how you think aliens created the face. I on the other hand have plenty of evidence to support my claim.

When the ""Face on Mars"" was first discovered the Viking 1 had found it by mistake. The Viking 1 was looking for a place for its sister ship to land, and stumbled on it by mistake. The picture the Viking 1 took resembled a human face but, it was very shadowy and not the clearist picture. When NASA reveled the ""Face on Mars"" it became the instant topic everywhere. Everywhere you went peope talked about the face.

NASA wasn't done with the face on Mars. On April 5, 1998, the Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time. Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Web sufers everywhere were whating for the first image to appear. When the imaage first appeared on a JPL web site it revealed a natural landform. There was no alien monument after. But of course not everyone was satisfied. Sadly it was winter it on the Red Planet. Thanks to all the wispy clouds, the camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face. Sadly clouds had covered parts of the Face. Some people still thought the Face was hiding alien markings.

On April 8, 2001a cloudless summer day in CydoniaMars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look. What was it going to find on a cloudless summer day in Cydonia? What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesalandforms common around the American West. It didnt't show any airplanes or Egyptian-style pyamids.

See Bob I have so much more avidence than you. Your alein markings were proven not true. All The Face actully showed was a butte or mesa. There were no alien Egyptian style markings. The face is just a simple land form on the face of the Red Planet.",3

I know this becasue in the text it says UNRRA hired ""Seagoing Cowboys"" to take care of the horses, young cows, and the mules that were shipped overseas. Another reason is in paragraph 9 it says Being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for Luke Bomberger. It opened up the world to him. ""I'm grtaeful for the opportunity,"" he says. ""It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs."" And that awarness stayed with him, leading his family to host a number of international students and exchange visitors for many years.

As he says in the story, ""Their cars have driven more than half a million miles without a crash, but so far, Google cars aren’t truly driverless:"". But in time i think they will get it to be driverless. i think the google cars would be a great ideal.

AAAOPP13416000026316,"My possition on driverless cars is, they are not a good idea. First of all people will try to sleep and or do something else that will distract them and it could possibly be a threat to road workers or pedestrians. Then if it does hit someone, paragraph 8 talks about who will be to blame? I personaly think that the driver would be to blame because he or she should be paying attention at all times to ensure nothing will happen.

What if it runs out of gas, or even has a mechanical problem? Will it completely crash into things or even people? Thats probably the biggest worry on the driverless cars to me. What if your were to get in a accident? The car my still try and go, causing even more damage!

In the past companys have been able to make self driving cars that had not made a single accident. In the early 50's or 60's Pontiac made a car that succesfully mad 5 laps around a closed corse without a single error! With the advance ments since then i think we should be able to make a car driverless, with new technology we should be able to make a full proof car by know, right? The only way i think they should be allowed is if they are one hundred percent full proof with absolutily no errors when in beta testing, with people out on the track to make sure there is no problems with pedestrians or road workers.

The passage informes the reader that many companies are working on the concept, of fully driverless car's. Seems scary but if it's safer than a human-driven car, then the world could just be that much safer.

My thought on driverless cars is that if its safer, then I'm up for it. My thing is though if their is a maulfuntion or a error in the programming, and a auto-mobile accident occurs then who fault is it? Because when you buy the car you are worry free of collision's or accidents and things of thar nature. So if the programs aren't ready for taking over human funtions, and its not 100% efficent for every day situations. It needs more work but eventualy it'll take place in history as the fisrt driverless car. As cool as it seems it could be more dangerous than human driver's. If it can be pulled off then im up for it.

My thought is any manufacturers that release these cars should be 100% sure that no error is in play. Its a very good idea in my opinon.",2

Driverless cars are a good thing because they're revolutionary, more manufacturers and states are looking forward to it, and becoming more dependable than the average car.

For the world to have cars that can drive themselves would be amazing and change the way we use or see cars in general.In this way, riverless cars would be revolutionary. In the article, it says, ""The cars he foresees would use half the fule of today's taxis and offer far more flexibility than a bus...such cars would fundementally change the world...founder of the Google Car project, beleives that the techknology has finally begun to catch up to the dream...They can steer, accelerate, and brake when the road ahead requires human skills."" This shows how using driverless cars could revolutionize the world.

Also, it can be even better with how manufacturers are beginning to welcome the idea of driverless cars. In the text, it states, "" Some manufacturers hope to dod that by bringing in-car entertainment...California, Nevada, Flordia, and the Distric of Columbia have led the country in allowing limited use of semi-autonomous cars;...more states will follow as soon ass cars are proved more reliably safe...a 2016 release for a car capable of driving on autopilot 90 percent of the time.

In the article, it states, ""...they still allert the driver to take over when pulling in and out of driveways or dealing with complicated traffic issues...Without the option of smarter roads, manufacturers turned to smarter cars..The combination of all this input is necessary for the driverless car to mimic the skill of a human at the wheel...The information from the sensors can cause the car to apply brakes on individual wheels to reduce power from the engine, allowing far better responce and control than a human driver could manage alone...While the driver watches the road, the car watches the driver...information stystems that use heads-up as diplays. Such displays can be turned off instantly when the driver needs to take over...In tihs way, the in-car system is actually a safety feature...""

AAAOPP13416000016229,"Driverless cars are becoming one of the many symbols of a new generation.

The thought of possibly no longer needing to buy a car seems to be a very settling thought, not to mention receiving a car that a person wouldn't need to control half of the time.

However, while cars today are already becoming expensive the more they evolve, could anyone imagine how much a driverless car would cost?

Especially if the cars have extremely advanced technology within every one of them?

Those cars would most likely cost twice as much as our modern cars already do.

One of the main factors that would motivate individuals to even consider buying a driverless car is so they can shift the blame to the manufacturer or the car itself, and not take responsibility for themselves if an accident occurs.

Manufacturers would have to take the heavy burdens for any severe injury, damage, or even death if one small thing goes out of place with the driverless car.

Driverless cars also seem like an excuse to continue the habit of texting and driving, which is already an issue that kills and injures more and more people every day.

Texting and driving is already a nasty habit that everyone is still trying to discourage.

If these driverless cars really don't require that much attention, enough to allow the driver to text, the habit will be twice as hard to let go of.

Having alert drivers feels more like a reassurance to safety rather than having nonalert ones that depend on their computer car to ensure other people's safety.

It's also likely that something could go wrong in the technology system.

Who really knows of something malfunctions, breaks, stops working, or everything else in between? Technology isn't always the most reliable thing on the planet since it has its many faults.

For example, if the seat is supposed to vibrate to alert the driver for attention, will it really vibrate on the first try? Will it vibrate on time? How about if the car can accelerate, break, and steer itself? Would it be able to all the time? What if it doesn't do one, the other, or any of those things? Very serious consequences come with that kind of malfunction.

Drivers shouldn't be discouraged to purchase a driverless car if they ever come into play in our lives.

It will have its cons just like our modern cars do, but there's no doubt that it will have its pros.

Our environment, laws, and technology would require some serious changing and tinkering if these cars are ever put to actual use.

Yes, it is illegal in most states to even do as much as test these cars. However, these states might reconsider their decision depending on how safe these cars express themselves to be.

These cars, personally, have shown to be quite hazardous and really expensive. Who knows? Maybe they'll be safer. Let's just wait and see.",3
AAAOPP13416000006900,"To begin, driverless cars have many more postives than negatives. Driveless cars really can be the future because of the way they are being developed and the advancement of technology. Many movies and TV shows have been facisnated with drvieless cars in the 1950s and 1980s but technology did not permit the creation of these cars because many things were needed for driveless cars to be safe and actually work. Driveless cars may alarm several people as dangerous or unreliable, but with new advances with technology and new laws driveless cars can be just as safe or better than cars the need humans to drive them.

Next, Driveless cars have come and are still coming long way. Google in 2009 had cars the could drive independently but needed to be under specific conditions. The cars google created did not crash for half a million miles but they were not truly driveless. As time has progressed driveless cars can be safely created. Driveless cars are created with amazing censors, and video cameras to help detect danger and mimic the skills of a human driver. The sensors in the cars are capable of as stated before detecting danger, but also causing the car to apply brakes and reduce the power of the engine.

Furthermore, Another postitive that driveless cars display are as follows; keeping the human alert so that if assistance is needed the human can assist and prevent dangerous accidents from happening. Even with driveless cars humans still should remain alert and focused in case something happens. General Motors even developed driver seats that vibrate when the vehicle is in danger of backing up into something. The driveless cars may not seem completly drive less but they really are, but even if the cars are completly driveless people should still pay attention and focus on the road.

Most importantly, the biggest concern is the safety of these cars and the fact that they don't appear to be completly driveless. Some manufactures appear to be working on that issue, many believe they will be able to solve the problem of the cars not fully being driveless and being safe.

This can be done by using heads-up displays which is a positive because it keeps the driver alert and is a safety feature and safety is a big concern. Laws have not changed and many laws believe that in order to keep drivers, and pedestrians safe would be to have alert drivers. These cars are a benefit and are just as safe as a human driving a car. With advancements in technology these cars will be safer than normal human driven cars. I support driveless cars one hundred percent and belive they eventually will be completly safe to drive

In conlusion, Driveless cars have many negative and postive aspects, but so does human driven cars. Just because a human is driving the car that does not mean they are focused and that an accident can not happen. Driveless cars with advancements in technology are prospering and proving

that they are safe and will eventually meet the requirements people have. These cars are taking awhile to develope but once they get done they will be just as safe or even safer than human driven cars. Driveless cars have sensors and videos camera that aid in their ability to perform their actions. Driveless care provide safety by alerting the humans of dangers and being able to apply brakes when needed. Driveless cars are the future and by 2020 will be just as safe as driving a regular car that requires human assistance. Driveless cars should be permitted by law because they are capable of being safe and getting the job done correctly.    ",4
AAAOPP13416000006231,"I am against the developement of driverless cars. I do not t think driverless cars are safe. In my opinion, I think driverless cars are more dangerous than driving a car normally. A problem can occur when the driverless car is driving. Maybe it is simply because there was a system malfunction with the car, or it could be because when the car tells the driver to take back over the driver is not paying attention. Someone will get injured, and it is not worth it.

Driverless cars are not completely driverless. Whether it is because the driver has to keep their hand on the wheel when the car is driving its self, or because the car will ask the driver to take over when it approaches a sticky situation. Yes, drivers do get tired of driving, but what's the point of having a driverless car if you still have to drive anyway? It's a waste of time and money. In paragraph nine, the author states that traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times. Therefore, it is illegal to even test computer-driven cars.

If there was an accident when the driverless car was driving, who would be a fault? The driver or the manufacturer. A driverless car is too much of a hassle to me. Maybe if in the future car dealerships make cars able to drive on there own no matter the situation, and it was completely 100% safe I would agree that driverless cars are the way to go. Although, as of right now, I am against driverless cars. Drivers should drive themselves wherever they need to go and not have a car driving for them.      ",2
AAAOPP13416000005886,"""The Face On Mars"" in the picture a Viking took in 1976 forms shadows on the picture to make it look like there are eyes, and a nose. As you compare them with pictures taken by a Mars global surveyor from 1998, you will see that the shadow of the nose and eyes are not as clear as in the picture taken by a Viking. In the photo also taken by a Mars Global surveyor in 2001, the shadows have disapeared from view. Some say that the first picture taken would be a sign of life on mars, others say that this odd shaped figure is a sign of aliens, but as the picture of the face is taken by the MGS the shadows disapear off of the figure.

As the image from 2001 spans 1.56 meaters compared to 43 meaters per pixel in the best Viking photo in 1976, this shows that the MGS took a better picture than the Viking in 1976. ""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in digital 3 times bigger than a pixel size"" showing that there are no shadows making the nose or eyes shape on the figure found on Mars. ""What the figure actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa, landforms common around the American West."" ""That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.""

Therefore, Garvin, who is a scientist says that the same shape takes place in the American West as well as on Mars. As some people say that NASA just wants to hide the finding of aliens or life on Mars, but why would NASA want to hide these finding knowing that the finding of something this big would profit NASA greatly? Garvin also states that ""That's a lava dome that takes form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars."" He says that the ""Face on Mars"" reminds him of most of Middle Butte in the Snale River Plain of Idaho, which proves that there are shapes idetical to the shape found on Mars.       ",3
AAAOPP13416000004622,"Driverless cars are not completely driverless yet. They still need asistance from a human being. In that case makes them safe, because a human will be alert at all times. Driverless cars have been around for quite some time. Driverless cars use less fuel,can cause less accidents and are very helpful.

In paragraph 1 it says ""The car he foresees would use half the fuel of today's taxis"". Saving fuel can help your environment a lot. It just saves us some resources. By saving fuel everyone saves money. An automatic car just needs

to be refilled

again and again and sometimes you may be on a tight budget. All that money that you do not spend on gas can be very helpful for bills or for groceries. It is as if life has just handed you lemons.

A driverless car can be very beneficial in preventing less accidents. In paragraph 7 it says "" They can steer, accelerate and brake themselves"". Of course they still need a human being. The car needs help driving through work zones and around accidents, so the driver needs to be paying attention at all times. If you were to get in an accident, which is unlikely, since you are driving a driverless car, since they brake themselves ,but with an automatic car , you at all times have to be aware and cautious of not getting in an accident because they can not stop on their own, you as the driver needs to be the one stopping it, which at situations like that, we tend to lose total control. Driverless cars, they can automatically stop you from crashing into another car or into something.

Driverless cars can be very helpful. A driverless car has a sensor it is like a second hand to the car, that sensor helps the car to stop when it needs to. Without the driver having to do anything, which is totally awesome because the driver just gets to enjoy the ride. The driverless car helps so much. It can be a huge help in preventing an accident, it helps you not to pass a stop light. because it already knows when to stop.

A driverless car is a gift. It is what everyone wants for Christmas. It uses less fuel, and can produce less accidents and is very helpful. A driverless car is better than an automic car. It does all the driving for you. all it needs is your assistance. Automtic cars are so last year!

In paragraph 2 it states ""Google has had cars that could drive independently under specific conditions since 2009"". Everyone should just switch to driverless cars for their own safety.                      ",4

in paragraph 1 it says how gas is supposed to be half the fuel of today's taxis. The driveless car is supposed to have far more flexibility than a bus. Another pro is their cars have driven more than half a million miles without crashing.

The driverless car also has cons. In the passage it says you have to have.""A spinnig sensor on the roof and Dubbed Lidar"". Im pretty sure those are gonna be very exspensive. Another con is the car alerts the driver when it needs help. What if your sleep or busy or something. Safety is a big con of the car. I say safety because in this passage it says ""Even testing computing driven cars is illegal in 3 states"". The passage says"" manafactuers believe that more states will follow as soon as the cars are proved more safe"".

In conclusion, If I was an average person looking for a car. I would not buy this. Buying this car only makes you more lazy and not all technology is safe.

AAAOPP13416000001665,"Self driving cars are gettiong closer to our generation as time passes. In my opinion self driving cars can be an amazing improvement to both our lives and society. You have less crashes, better programming and software in the car, and more family time. If one thing's sure is that with our technology combined with the future's techonolgy self-driven cars are a reality waiting to happen.

First of all you can have less crashes with self driving cars. Most accidents are originated by humans texting while driving, keeping your eyes of the road for family discussions or simply falling asleep on the wheel. In paragraph one it says, ""Their cars have driven more than half a million miles without a crash."" This refers to Google"" semi self-driven car. It's not fully capable of driving alone, but it had no carshes. Also in the story says it was since 2009. That's about seven years ago. With all the technology we have now our future seems brighter and self-driven cars seem a dream we are soon going to be able to accomplish.

Now a days engineers are taking cars to a whole other step. Cars have good software installed for predicting gas and oil leaks and parking backwards. Also on a Volkswagen Jetta 2016 if you're not paying attention it can break while about to rear end another car. These are all great programming and software changes. Later on we can eventually get software that will be able to make the car keep an eye on the road. It can have sensors that alert weather cars are coming from either right or left direction so it can stop. Also sensors by the tires that could eventually monitor the ground surface around it make sure there's no holes or other hazards. Car proggraming is gradually improving, and with all the technology we have now and the one we'll have in the future we will be able to have self driving cars in about

the next fifty years.

Crashes occur when arguing with family members, getting distracted while talking to them, or simply just trying to socialize while you drive. These cars are improvements to daily life

and reuniting families. On a road trip you have teenagers on their phones while the kids scream in the back and parents concentrate on the road. there's no time to talk, so by the car driving itself you can surely talk to your family on a family trip or any occasion you drive. Phones won't interrupt and your family could be close once again. Maybe this is a long shot, but with cars driving themselves this could also just be something waiting to happen. Self driving cars will be usefull in the future, and family time will be very good to have on that long roadtrip.

As our generation advances self-driven cars seem to be closer and closer to us. Cars will be an improvent to our lives and society. Cars will be able to prevent most crashes, and they will also have better programing and software that will be usefull on the road. Families will also be able to have more time together.

AAAOPP13416000001243,"These cars have a good effect as well as a bad. The smarter cars focus on keeping the drivers, passengers, and pedestrians safe. You may be asking yourself, ""is it really a safer option?"" Yes it is. These cars require little to no human control, They have all kinds of sensors, and are well tested before sold.

These cars requiring little human control is a good thing. All the human has to do is watch the road. Most accidents are caused because someone brakes to fast or speeds and hits another car. With the smart cars the human won't be in control of any of that. The car will drive 25 mph avoiding speeding tickets and accidents. The driver will be prepared to take over any time the car does not succeed.

It cant get safer than senors. These cars have a video camera mounted near the review mirror, four automotive radar senors, a gps reciever, and an inertial motion sensor; It can sense every human motion. The senors make sure the driver keeps both hands on the wheel. The seat will vibrate if the car is in danger of backing into an object. The car can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves. They are still improving sensors to make driving safer and leading to cars that can handle more and more driving tasks on their own.

The cars are not just thrown in stores to be sold, they are well tested. In some states you are not even aloud to test them. They will not release any cars without making sure your safty isn't at stake. They are working on liability laws in case of an accident. If someone happens to get hurt because of technology fail, it will be covered.

These cars are very safe. There really isn't any way to get into an accident because of all the senors. You also dont have to worry about getting a speeding ticket. If anything serious was about to happen the car will alert the driver to take over. These cars require little to no human control, they have all kinds of sensors, and are well tested before sold.

5380524,"Walking into the voting booth ""...every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November"" (Office Of Federal Register 6), the people of the United States of America expect their vote to count. Although, the president is elected in a more indirect way, by the electoral college, which does not represent the people, and is not fair. The president should be elected by popular vote from now on.

The first problem that the electoral college faces is the fact that it does not truly represent the opinion of the people. First, voters can walk into the booth and ""...get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate"" (Plumer 10). Not every voter is educated on exactly how the electors and candidates are represented on the ballot and that may lead to an accidental win. On top of this misconception, almost decietfully, an elector promised to a candidate can change their vote at a moments notice(Plumer 10). Even Posner who writes for the electoral college admitted that it is possible, and he claims that it is ""rare"";however, it has happened before in 1960 (Plumer 11), and not even Posner can control the actions of an elector, legally anyway. Also, when a candidate wins a popular vote, which is the true mind of the people, that candidate still may not win the electoral vote, overall, loosing the election. This happened just a few years back in the 2000 election between President Bush and Gore(Posner 16).All in all, the electoral college does not represnt the people.

Looking deeper into the subject, elections by the electoral college are not fair. The first example appears in the method of the ""...""winner-take-all"" system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate""(Office of Federal Register 7). Because of this system, Presidential candidates may not feel the need to campaign to all people, just those of the states with the highest amount of electoral votes(Plumer 13). This goes against the american concept of ""all men are created equal"", leaving voters feeling undervauled and not important. Second, ""A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total number of votes-538- is an even number.."" (Posner 18). Although this tie is claimed to be ""highly unlikely"". However, an election by popular vote would make the conundrum even further unlikely by the general logic of the fact that it is a lot less possible for the opinion of an entire nation to be split down the middle than that of 538 electors. Another issue with a tie in the electoral college lies in how that draw is resolved. The  tie-breaker is left to the representatives in congress, and ""Because each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming...would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California..."" (Plumer 12). This simply does not give all the voters equal say in who wins the election. All of these topics and more compressed together represent how un fair the election truly is.

Entering the booth next election day, dont only think about who you are voting for, but also how you are voting for them. It makes all the difference, and, ultimately, the popular way is the best way.    ",5
5342224,"Dear Flordia State Senator:

The Electoral College is a very useful and easy was of voting. According to the article

""What Is the Electoral College""

by the Office of the Federal Register, ""The Electoral College process consists of the selection of th electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress."" Basically we vote for our electors which then they vote for the President which seem to be working just fine why change it?

There are many resons why people are in favor of changing the Electoral College for popular vote. In the article

""Why  even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong""

by Bradford Plumer he asks ""Can voters  control whom their electors vote for?"" Then answers himself with ""Not always."" This may be true but voters do get to vote for thier electors and it is the voters job to vote for the one they believe will choose the right president. The people need to put faith in thier electors, and even if the Electoral College was changed to popular vote they would have to vote for the president and put faith in him or her to make the right decisions for them, is they same basic thing but having electors are just another step.

""The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states (by population) lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution"" This was stated in the article ""

Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President""

by Richard A. Posner. This is a very good point he made, the larger states get more attention than the smaller states when it comes to  popular voting in presidental elections because they have a much larger population giving them more votes.

When it comes to popular voting there have been times where no canidate has a mojority cast of votes and the Electoral College Prevents that problem. In  1968 Nixon received 43 percent pluraltiy or more votes than the other canidates but still not receving a clear majority of votes in the popular votes same with Clinton in 1992 but they both won majority in the Electroral College, so there was no need for and run-off election.

I believe that we shouldn't change the Electoral College for popular votes the way we arevoting now is working just fine and it makes it so larger states like Texas don't get more of an impact on the election because of thier population than smaller states like Rhode Island. Also the Electoral College prevents Run-off elections. Even though some believe the Electoral College as an anachronism I think that the Electoral College is still a good way of voting.

5341819,"In Vauban Germany, the people in the suburbs have stopped driving. Parking or housing a car predominately prohibited and the only vehicle you'd see is the tram that take citizens from the edge of the community or to downtown Freiburg. You can own a car, but the parking space is incredibly limited, sometimes even expensive.

The residents aren't complaining. 57% of the population even had sold their car to live in Vauban, one woman even stating she felt less tense without a vehicle.

The growing trend of reducing automotive use in suburban lifestyles is a role in a movement known as ""smart planning."" Cars are often heavily populated in the suburbs, which hinders the efforts to reduce greenhouse gas tailpipe emissions, as up to 50% of greenhouse gas emissions in the US come from cars.

Many of the world is now slowly following Vauban's steps with actions like reducing the size of suburbs and and giving its residents more access to public transportation. Rather than creating distant malls along highways, stores are being placed on a main street that's a walk away.

In Paris, after dealing with a nearly record-high amount of smog, a driving ban was enforced to reduce and/or clear out the pollution. Public transit was free and the smog managed to clear enough that cars with odd-numbered plates were allowed to be put in use again.

Bogota, California also took part in a day without passenger vehicles, with only buses and taxis in commision. On Day Without Cars, 7 million people rode bikes, skated, hiked, or took a bus to their job. It's believed to help reduce pollution and reduce stress. Thanks to the day, parks and sport centers have appeared, sidewalks made smoother and broadened, rush-hour rules designed to cute traffic, and plenty of new shops and dining places within short distance.

Recents studies also appear reveal a decrease in car purchases as time passes, raising the question of America's interest in automotives and driving. As of 2013, an average person drove 9% below the peak, identical to where is was in 1995. While the price of cars is a factor taken into consideration, the decrease hopefully hints to a more permanent drop in car use.

With this comes a benificial lessen of carbon emmissions, conserve resources and improve safety. Only time will tell where it will go from here.    ",2

5299619,"Dear state senator,

Electoral College shouldn't even be used anymore because it is widely regarded as an anachronism. In the Electoral College it's the electors who elect the president not the people. People should be able to vote for the president they want and not have electors elect the president. If the electors are electing the president they want then why even let the people vote only for them to be disappointed. Also when voting for a presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors. There are many reasons for retaining the Electoral College other then there lack of democratic pedigree.

A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote wouldn't be the first since it has already happened in 2000. The reason is the the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote. In 2012 election, Obama recieved 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular vote cast for him and Romney. Cause almost all states award electoral votes and a state creates a landslide electoral-vote victory in that state. A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total number of votes-538- is an even number but this is highly unlikely.

Overall you will decide what is best for this state but just take in mind my idea how the Electoral doesn't benefit the people nor you.

Sincerly, a citizen who cares.                                             ",2
5196711,"The electoral college has been around for as long as our nation has reined over this land. I fervently believe we should keep the electoral college as it is. We, as people, are not ready for the responability of choosing our next leader directly viva popular vote. Some of us might be ready for this responability now, but the magority of America cannot handel this responibity. The majority has stared riots over lost football games, acknolaged said riots and justifyed them then turn around and see a riot about a kid being shot 6 times by an officer and send in swat teams and start throwing smoke bombs. Because of these actions and the many like it, I whole-heartedly believe if we leave the responability to chose our president in the magority vote that this country will become more unstable than it already it because, most people already do not vote, some are biast, and some dont follow the consititution when they vote.

To begin with, letting the majority vote on our new president would have potential if the whole of the country voted, but alas only a small essence of the country votes for our future leaders. Most people are too busy, or lazy, or just dont want to take part in voting becuse of all of the conficting ads placed on television. One of the most atrocious of these ads was the one from mitt romney when he was in the race against President Obama. They put these ads on a chanel designated for familys to veiw, along with children. These ads inculded vivid pictures of aborted fetus, saying this is what would happen if we voted for obama. I've only saw that ad once, but once was more than enough to make me side with Obama more than I already was. If our president is prepared to threten the country like that then they should not be eligable to even run, let alone become President, and it was horendus to think of all of the children watching at the time to have to see that. Most Americans who are eligable to vote have full-time jobs, full-time school, or are busy in some other aspects of life. These people do not have the time to vote for our president becuase they are working at the time, most work one or two jobs at the least, leaving little time for social graces and time alone, let alone time to vote. One other reason citizens dont vote is just hte sheer fact that they are lazy. A good precetage of Americans just do not care about who our president is or who runs for office, thus not voting out of sheer laziness.

Furthermore, letting the majority vote rule who is our president would have potential if the majority of America was not biased in who they vote for. Almost all Americans have voted baised on their beliefs, or who is running for president. These are the people who voted agaoinst obama becuase of his ethnic background, or what he looked like. This should not go against who we vote for, or who leads us, as long as they are non-biased in what they stand for and have the good of the people in their minds, then they should be eligable, or even voted, as a canidate/president/offical.

To continue, letting the majority vote on our new president would have potential if the majority of Americans followed the consititution when voting. The majority does not follow the consitiution when voting for our new president, thus inducing an unfair campaine and an biased leader. The consitiution clearly states the Church and State are to be seperated, yet many Americans vote baised on the beliefs of their Church on matters of the State. The latest case of this happening was for the ban on gay marrige. Most voters voted in favor of the ban due a passage in the bible that stated that man shall not lay with another man as he lays with a woman, even though there is a homosexual couple in the bible, mathew/mathius something. The story aout a man named Dave and another named John, if i remember correctly, one of them said ""your love exceeds that of a woman"" or something close to that. There are a number of testiments that say not to judge others or to love everyone, but most focus on the one against those. Baising your vote on spiritual beliefs does not help anyone and is unfair towards those whos lifes you are negativly affecting. We should all think logically when voting for our leaders, and ask questions like 'who will this affect' 'how will this improve apon the lifes of my fellow Americans' 'will this improve our dilapitiating economy and crippling structe of the government' along with other questions that relate to how this canidate will improve apon the country as a whole.

All in all, I believe that the electoral college should stay in affect untill America, as a whole, grows up, becuase most dont vote, some who vote are biased, and some dont follow the consitiution when voting. We should not have to write papers on why we shouldnt let the people of America vote directly for our leader, nor should we have to have our rights taken away from those who use their religous prectices as an excuse to hate someone. We, the people, should all live together in this country, equaly, as one, not letting our beliefs negativly affect the lives of others. We should be able to practice what we want, when we want, without having to be fearful that others might punish us baised on what they practice. We, the people, need to grow up before we are allowed to vote directly for our new leaders. And that is why i beileve that the electoral college should stay in effect.    ",2
5188677,"""A new president, really, How many votes did they win by?"" If someone were to ask you this what would you say, thirty electoral votes? The ""Winner-Takes-All"" system is flawed and needs to be either fixed or completly taken down, and here are two reasons why. First a president should be chosen by the people, seeing our county is a democracy meaning that we elect representatives to rule for us, a popular vote fits the sene a bit more than an electoral vote. Secondly if there was every a tie in the electoral college it would catostropic because intead if being in the peoples hand it be in the representatives hands, aslo known as the ones who already have power.

""At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. because of the winner-takes-all system in each state canidates dont spend time in states they spend no time in stats the know thy wont win."" Some states can get no canidates out and its because the electoral college is unfair. ""It`s official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best argumants in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. And the arguments against direct election ar spurios at best. Its hard to say but Bob Dole was right: Abolish the electoral college!"" This Quote states that the electoral college is not fair and down right rediculus. You may say since its getting the job done and there has been no ties whats wrong? there are manny thing wrong startign with popular votes can lose to electoral votes, also some states can get on people to come and campagne.

"" In 1968 a sift of just 41,971 could have cause a tie in the polls."" in this article just that many people and the representatives could have chosen a president and the reason this is bad is because they will get a president that will do what ever they want. ""If there were just 5,559 voters in ohio and 3,687 voters in hawaii that went the other way the electoral college would have tied making a representative choose."" "" in this article just that many people and the representatives could have chosen a president and the reason this is bad is because they will get a president that will do what ever they want.

So to finalize The ""Winner-Takes-All"" system is flawed and needs to be either fixed or completly taken down, and here are two reasons why. First a president should be chosen by the people, seeing our county is a democracy meaning that we elect representatives to rule for us, a popular vote fits the sene a bit more than an electoral vote.

5184600,"dear state senator, i believe that we should abolish the electoal college and just leave up to populare vote. The electoral college should be abolished because it is unfair, and it poses a threat to the U.S constitution.

The electoral college is unfair because it takes away the demicratic way of society that our founding fathers set up. In the United States of America we leave it up to the people to vote but if the people of the united states vote someone in an he doesnt get to run the country because the electoral college decided diffrently then we should not be called a democracy. For example in the 2000 election with Al Gore and Gorge W. Bush, the people of the united states voted for Al Gore, but due to the electoral college Bush won the election. in the passage The Indefensible Electoral College it says ""Over 60% of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now."" what does that tell you? more then half of the USA would prefer a people vote instead of both!

Furthurmore, I believe we should due away with the electoral college because it poses a threat to the U.S constitution. when i say this i mean it is a threat to the citizens of the USA. the people of the united states were thought to vote our president in? but if the majority of voters vote for someone an the other oponent wins then where is the domocracy in that? also in the artical The Indefensible Electoral College  says ""oh what if a state sends two slates of electors to congress? it happened in hawaii in 1960. Luckily, vice president Richard Nixon, who was presiding over the senate, vatlidated only his opponent's electors."" imagin if that happens again an someone doesnt notice that? then there will be double slaters an there bound to vote for the same canidate so that will be an easy state to win for that canidate. The electoral college is nothing but problems.

In conclution, The electoral college should be abolished because it is unfair, and it poses a threat to the U.S constitution. You make your conclution based on this Mr. senator            ",4
5180925,"The electoral college should be abolished because when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidates elector (source 1), and the voters cant always control who their electors vote for (source 2). On the other hand the electoral college is a great thing because a dispute over the outcome of an electoral college vote is possibe but its less likely than a dispute over the popular vote (source 3).

When you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidates elector (source 1). Most people, including me, would like to vote for the president not a candidate because they might not even vote for the person you want for president. Some states are smaller then others so that makes them feel like their votes arent as important as the bigger states like California and Texas. The electoral college consists of only 538 electors compared to how many people are actually in the U.S. so there is a greater chance that the wrong president might be elected.

Many people do not vote because the voters cant always control who their electors vote for (source 2). Not everyone wants to take the chance of voting for the wrong person to be elected for president. Some voters might get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate, as it says in source 2. Most states are small so most people in those states dont think the little states matter and they arent important in the election when they actually do.

On the other hand the electoral college is a great thing because a dispute over the outcome of an electoral college vote is possibe but its less likely than a dispute over the popular vote (source 3). A better thing about the electoral college is that it requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal, meaning that not all the vote can come from one or two regions and no other ones. Voters in presidential elections are the people who want to express a political preference rather than the people woh tihnk a single vote can dicide an election.

As a student I want the best for the up coming generations, including me, that are going to be able to be a part of the presidential elections and to not be confused who to vote for or how the electoral college works. Every year a new generation becomes legal to vote and be part of the election but if they dont know how to vote or how it works then they wont be able to. Some people dont know anything about poitics but, still want to be able to vote so, it should be easy for them to vote for who they want to be president rather then the long process of, voting for the canidates elector and most of the time they dont vote for who they want and they vote for the wrong person.                                                    ",4
5180602,"We should keep the elcetoral college because it was made by out founding fathers and should be kept alive. Not only that but it has been around for so long that it would be difficult getting use to the change. By keeping the electoral college we keep a non-democratic way of voting for out presidents. Betrayal dosent often happen because we put trust into the people we sent to the electoral college. By keeping the electoral college we also keep the chance of any runner winning, unlike if normal people got to have their votes count someone would always ain by a landslide. By also keeping the electoral college we make it so their is no chance of a tie. Like if a person from the electoral college were to betray his state.

If it were to happen the state would be very disappionted and would look down upon him or her. By keeping the electoral college we make it so the its difficult for one person to betray his or her  state. We all expect them to make the right choise for the whole state and they feel that pressure. Everyone only influences what the person is going to pick. But some people fold under pressure and do what the  other person wants. That can also be a good thing.

By putting people under pressure with a whole state on their back people would choose who ever their state wants. If every state thinks differntly then their would still be a chance for the other person to win even if other states voted for the other person. If one person got a lot of states to like them then the other peson wouldnt stand a chance if real people were voting and they would lose against a landslide victory. There would also be major fights and outbrakes of violence if we got rid of the electoral college. If you had a friend that voted for the person you didnt want to win and they won you would mad and argry. They would just rub it in your face and say you lost and could lead to fights or even killings. The smart desion would be to keep the electoral college.

By keeping it everyone is happy and will accept things easier. But if we were to abolish it the towns and cities would go and rampage with families borken and friendships being torn apart. And we can prevent that by just keeping the electoral college.    ",3
5176685,"Hello, I am writing to you about the Electoral College and why that I think it should be removed. Why I think we should remove the Electoral College is when voter selects the president they want they are really just picking for a elector who elects the president for them. Also this makes a single rep from Wyoming of 500,00 people has as much say as 55 reps for California who represents 35 million people. The last reason behind this is also being unfair to voters, the winner take all system where in the state the winner of the votes gets them all. So in effect a candidate would spend no time in that per say a swing state. which the may have a chance of winning.

When you vote for the president you really are not voting for him, you're voting for a elector who really elect the president. Also the question is brought up, who picks the electors? This also depends on the state could be the state party's central committee or the presidential candidate's people do. Also another question is what controls the elector from electing the wrong candidate, nothing.

Also why does a single reps in Wyoming with 500,00 people have as much say as 55 reps in California with 35 million people? That is just unfair to the voters, how could that in anyway represent what the majority of the people want. The other way the electoral collage is unfair is the winner take all system I mentioned earlier with majority votes in a state is the state vote, such as if 46 percent of people in a state voted one candidate and 54 for the other insted of just giving the candidates their votes the majority decided one would have them.

The Electoral College is also not a democratic system of voting because the people are really not deciding, and when it is said you are allowing each party to pick a trusted slate of nominees it is not true because the state's central committee not the presidential candidate's reps who are the people really needed to vote for such. In 2000 Gore had more popular votes than bush but less electoral votes, though rare to happen this the president who runs the country for four years at a time so that one rare moment could mean the future of the U.S.A . Also a president does not need to be trans-regional, they only need to appeal to swing states and not ruin relations with their states.

So that was and is my reasoning of why I think that the Electoral College should be removed from our political system. Between the being unfair to voters through voting for electors not even the president, reps not even being scaled right also the winner take all system making the system unbalanced, and the presidential candidates not even needing to appeal to most states just the swing states. I hope this passage convinces you that the Electoral College should be removed in place of a better system that is not out dated.                    ",4
5074830,"Cars are not something that have to be used everyday. Limiting car usage could be a good thing to do. Minimizing car usage gives you the opportunity to have more parks and fun places to go without the parking lot taking up all the space.

Less space for parking makes everything more easier to get to which is an advantage instead of having to walk in the parking lot . For example, "" . . . make suburbs more compact and more accessible to public transportation, with less space for parking."" ( In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars, Elisabeth Rosenthal, Paragraph 6 ). This explains that if you get rid of the cars theres more space to park and everything else becomes easier to get to versus having many parking spaces taking up room and causing traffic and other things. Also with not using cars theres more room for small stores and big stores to be put in different places that couldnt be put there because of cars so you could drive. For example, "" . . . stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway."" ( In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars, Elisabeth Rosenthal, Paragraph 6 ) and "" Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour retsrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up."" (Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota, Andrew Selsky, Paragraph 28). This shows that now there's more spaces for even more stores which is an advantage because the cars used to take up that space used for bigger roads for more cars to come on but without that problem theres room for other thing's.

Also it's a good way to save money because it decreases smog, and air polllution. For example, "" Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog."" ( Paris bans driving due to smog, Robert Duffer, Paragraph 14).  This shows that after France decided to stop using cars the smog decreased tremendisely. Having no vehicles can also make the environment better because there wouldnt be a lot of carbon being produced. For example, "" . . . it will have a benificial implications for carbon emissions and the environment."" ( The End of Car Culture, Elisabeth Rosentha, Paragraph 34). Which is an example of how it could better for the environment. An advantage also is there will be less pollution. For example, ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution . . ."" This explains that it would be a good thing for us , we would have better breathing and also again a better environment .

In Conclusion, Minimizing driving usage could lead to better things such as less pollution, a better environment , and lastly more room for other things . So theyre are many advantages to minimizing driving usage, it's not so bad.                            ",4
5061077,"Air pollution has been a major issue in the U.S for quite some time now. The number one cause of air polution is car exauhst emisions. Engine exauhst from a cars tailpipe shoots into the air we breathe ever so often. Limiting the use of cars would exponentially help reduce the amount of air poluition we have within the U.S today. Knowing this, our main concern as humans right now should be trying to limting car usage in order to reduce harmful greenhouse emissions that cause air pollution and smog.

In Vauban, Germany, citizens have give up their cars and have moved into an experimental upscale community where cars are not highly used. Even though car ownership is allowed, there are only two locations to park the vehichle and would cost $40,000 to buy the parking space. As a result, 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold their cars in order to move into the experimental community. Media trainer and mother of two, Heidren Walter says:""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" Germany has already taken a first step in order to help reduce car emissions in the air. David Goldberg, an official of transportation for America states:""All of our development since world was II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change."" In Europe, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions while the United States is responsible for up to 50 percent greenhouse gas emissions in some car-intensive areas.

On Monday in Paris, motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31). The same ban applied to odd-numbered license plates the following day. Sadly almost 4,000 drivers were fined and twent-seven people had their cars impounded. In the capital of France, congestion of smog was down 60 percent after five-days. Diesel fuel is the leading blame, since France has a tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline. Diesel makes up 67 percent of vehicles in France, compared to a 53.3 percent average of diesel engines in the rest of Western Europe, according to Reuters. Not only is Germany taking small steps in order to reduce air pollution by limiting cars but Paris is also doing the same thing to help reduce smog.

Not only is Germnay and Paris trying to limit car usage but so is Colombia. In Bogota, Colombia; there is a program they have in which millions of Colombians either skate, bike, hike or took public transportation in order to get to work for one day out of the entire year. The goal is to promote alternative transportatin and reduce smog. Violators would face a fine of $25. Businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza commented:""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" Two other Colomian cities, Cali and Valledupar, have decided to join the event in order to help reduce car usage.

Now we finally reach the United States after hearing about Germany, Paris, and Paris in terms of trying to limit the use of cars. Michael Sivak, who studies the trend of car usgae in America and is a reasearch professor at the University of Michigan's Transportation Research Institute, reports:""What most intrigues me is that rates of car ownership per household and per person started to come down to two to three years before the downturn, I think that means something more fundamental is going on."" Mr. Sivak's research has found demogaphic shifts in the driving populations that suggest that the trend may accelerate. There has been a large drop in the percentage of 16-39-year-olds getting a license, while older people are likely to retain their license at they age. A study last year has also found that driving by young people decresaed 23 percent between 2001 and 2009.

Limitng the use of cars is starting to slowy take its place within the United States, Germany, Paris, and even Colombia. Hopefully more and more people around the world will do their part in order to help reduce greenhouse emissions such as smog and air pollution.    ",2
5030541,"As human beings we must care for the earth that was so kindly bestowed upon us, meaning we must do all in our power to prevent it from self-destructing due to our carlessness. One way we seem to have recently discoved we can make a difference is that the limiting of car usage is an enormous step towards our goal. Cars have been a topic of contriversy worldwide, as it seems people refused to stop the usage of such a helpful tool in todays society, but as time goes on we have opened our eyes to a world of better choices. Citizens from all around see that car usage can be cut down, and it will be an astonishing change for both humans, as well as the earth. The limitation of car usage will provide a more healthy enviornment for the earth as well as those who live on it. Cars are a simply a machine in which we have allowed ourselves to believe that life can not go on without it. Here we will discover how truley wrong we were.

Although we all understand that these vehicles allow use to save much time by getting us to our destinations quicker, it does alot of harm to our planet as well. As stated in the article, ""In German Suburb, Life Goes on Without Cars"", cars are responsible for 50 percent greenhouse gas emission in certain areas of the United states. The fuel we use to power our cars is released into the O-Zone layer, and into our atmosphere which creates a greenhouse affect and slowly, but surley destroys our enviornment. However, we have the power to protect the planet we live on for we have so many different choices of transpertation that causes way less harm. Cutting down on driving is a simple task in which we can all participate in.

Next we focus more on how car limiation affects ourselves. Driving take a toll on us because other forms of transportation do so much good towards ones self being, but as humans we seem to always take the easy way out. If we didnt always use cars, and took a walk for instance it would improve health as well as many other things. In an artice written by Andrew Selsky it states that ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" The less smog in the air, the better we can breath which will improve our health, and walking is good for that as well. We don""t need cars to live our lives. Life goes on without the use of a machine.

All in all cars we must care for this world as well as ourselves, and this is the first step towards this goal. Some fear that this change in society will have horrible consequences because we are so use to cars in our life, but these vehicles dont control us. By use limiting car usage we are providing a healthier enviornment for both human beings as well as our earth. Lets take the steps toward making this world a better place to live for us as well as the many generations to come. Don't you wish to live in a clean, and healthy world?    ",4

Another adavantage to limting car use is that it can relieve stress in a person and it can actually make a person happier. And last people wont have to worry about getting late to school or to work or even about accidents. i dont know about you but limiting car use can be of great benefit and does have its advantages.

Our earth's enviorments are falling apart. And everyday we damage it more and more with all the polution and carbon emissions. 'It a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce green house gas emissions from tailpipes...Passenger car are responsible for 12 percent of green house gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States.

For expamle Paris, after days of near record pollution Paris had to enforce a partial driving ban to clear the air of the harmful chemicals. 'Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five days of intesifying smog... the smog rivaled Beijing, China, which os known as one of the most populated cities in the world. So limting car use can have its advantages, it can protect our enviorments. And we dont have to worry about smogs are any other things.

Who doesnt want to be stress free? And thats another advantage of limting car use. I always see how my mom stresses while she's driving which can cause accidents because people are always in a rush. 'When i had a car i was always tense. I'm much happier this way' said Heidrun Walter. It woulld be safer you dont have to worry has much about crossing the street. The swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drowns out the occasional distant motor. There are many alternative transportation such as hiking, biking, skates, and busues. This cab be helpful for the body and mind. 'Its a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air polluttion'.

The rates of car owernship have gone down. And it continues to go down.'If this pattern persists and many sociolgists belive it will, it will have benefecial implcatiions of carbon emmisions nd the enviorment, since transportation is the second largest source of americans emissions, just behind power plants. But this can have a negavtive impact on the car industries such as the companies ike Ford and Audi. But limiting car usgae can prevent trafiic jams and even accidents.

In, conclusion limiting car usgae does have its advantages. It can protect our Earth's envioremnts, it can relive stress and make a person happier, and it can result in less traffic jams and accidents. I think these things are more important than anything else. Its a great way to take away the stress and lower the air pollution. Limiting car usage does have its wonderful benefits and advantages.

5026854,"Every four years america as a whole chooses on who should be the president of the united states. The process of election is straight forward and always follows the same process every election. The american citizens vote on one of the two candidates, then those votes are counted and giving to the electors, then the electors of each state representing the population of said state (including the District of Columbia) votes one of the candidates, after all votes are tallied the winning candidate is elected president. Overall this system seems rather complicated and can be seen as an unfair process at which only to vote on who takes charge of america. The electoral college should be replaced by who receives the most popular votes from all american citizens and not the state electorals.

Electoral college is a process created during the founding of the united states as sort of a ""middleground"" or compromise on how the people of the country should elect the president (

source 1

). In order for a president to be elected out of the 538 electors that make up the electoral college he or she must at least receive 270 votes (

source 1

). Each president has a group of electors that process your votes in order to choose who the state votes for making it in a ways unfair. This system can come with its own set of problems that include replacement of electors, electors voting to who they feel, and at times one candidate gaining the most popular vote but losing the chance of presidency because of the lack of electorol votes form the state (

source 2

). An example of the unbalanced power is the near success of the louisiana legislature replacing the democratic electors in the 1960, segrigations with new ones that would oppose against John F. Kennedy making him lose the popular vote.

The best replacement for the electoral college is to allow the citizens of america to vote upon who should be the president of the U.S without the need for electors. The candidate that receives the most votes is the one who becomes the president of the united states. In order to process all possible millions of votes into a rational percentage and the candidate with the higher percentage would in turn become president. With this in mind the candidates would need to visit all or largely selected states in order to deliver campaign speeches to persuade the population to vote for them, because with the electoral college system candidates would focus mainly on tight races in the ""swing states"" practically ignoring other like in the 2000 campaign seventeen states didnt see their candidate (

source 2

). The electoral college only focuses on the large numbers and not on the smaller population that can still make a difference making the system unfair. Making them only focus on the big states because how many electoral votes it could bring compared to a smaller state which could possibly only supply three.

On the other side electoral college does have a good standing as a method of vote. Electoral college has five good reasons on why it shouldn't be replaced and they are certainty of outcom, everyone's president, swing states, Big states, and avoid run-off elections (

source 3

). Each campaign party chooses their electors which rarely end in betrayel making it possible to win the election with low popularity votes. The electoral system also gives the candidate a chance to win in a ""landslide"" because of the winner-take-all basis at which it follows (

source 3

). No region has enough votes to elect a president also the electoral college needs to have transregional appeal. And the main goal of the electoral college is to obviously elect a new president but as well avoid runoff elections.

The electoral college is an unfair system of voting because of how it all depends on a small group of selected representatives and not all of the american population as a whole. Even though it can be regarded as a fair middle ground it still has its flaws and doesnt reach out to society as a whole only focusing on the states that can lead to victory, casting out those who's electoral votes will not make much of a difference. In the end the voting system should mainly focus on popularity of a candidate than what the ""state"" feels they should vote for because of how many votes they actually received for a given candidate due to the fact that it may end up voting on which who they feel and refuse to vote for their partys candidate. The electoral system should be replaced.    ",5

""Oh, NASA killed JFK because he knew that theywere going to fake the moon landing."" OTHER_PII, I am going to hit you with this ridiculously oversized algebra book if you don't shut up. 1. JFK was killed by Lee Harvey Oswald, a Communist, and 2. NASA wouldn't fake something that big.We might be Americans, but that's stretching it. Now, the Face is a natural formation that the article said ""is a lava dome in the form of a mesa."" The Face might look like an ancient Egyptian pharoh, but there are billions of galaxies in this universe. If each galaxy has 1 planet with similar conditions to that of Earth, and they all had life forms on them that are presumeably far more advanced than that of humans, the sky above us wouldn't really be visible, as spaceships would be flying around it all the time. NASA has tried communicating with aliens. They have failed because aliens don't exist. Therefore, aliens and moon Nazis do not exist and cannot create statues or anything else as they are fake. The face is a natural made Martian landmark, and Martian is just a term used to refer to something that is related to Mars. As you can see,the Face is just another rock on Mars.",2
